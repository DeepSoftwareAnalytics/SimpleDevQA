        "document": "Eager to get started? This page gives a good introduction in how to get started with Requests.\n\nFirst, make sure that:\n\nLet’s get started with some simple examples.\n\nMaking a request with Requests is very simple. Now, let’s try to get a webpage. For this example, let’s get GitHub’s public timeline: Now, we have a object called . We can get all the information we need from this object. Requests’ simple API means that all forms of HTTP request are as obvious. For example, this is how you make an HTTP POST request: Nice, right? What about the other HTTP request types: PUT, DELETE, HEAD and OPTIONS? These are all just as simple: That’s all well and good, but it’s also only the start of what Requests can do.\n\nYou often want to send some sort of data in the URL’s query string. If you were constructing the URL by hand, this data would be given as key/value pairs in the URL after a question mark, e.g. . Requests allows you to provide these arguments as a dictionary of strings, using the keyword argument. As an example, if you wanted to pass and to , you would use the following code: You can see that the URL has been correctly encoded by printing the URL: Note that any dictionary key whose value is will not be added to the URL’s query string. You can also pass a list of items as a value:\n\nWe can read the content of the server’s response. Consider the GitHub timeline again: Requests will automatically decode content from the server. Most unicode charsets are seamlessly decoded. When you make a request, Requests makes educated guesses about the encoding of the response based on the HTTP headers. The text encoding guessed by Requests is used when you access . You can find out what encoding Requests is using, and change it, using the property: If you change the encoding, Requests will use the new value of whenever you call . You might want to do this in any situation where you can apply special logic to work out what the encoding of the content will be. For example, HTML and XML have the ability to specify their encoding in their body. In situations like this, you should use to find the encoding, and then set . This will let you use with the correct encoding. Requests will also use custom encodings in the event that you need them. If you have created your own encoding and registered it with the module, you can simply use the codec name as the value of and Requests will handle the decoding for you.\n\nThere’s also a builtin JSON decoder, in case you’re dealing with JSON data: In case the JSON decoding fails, raises an exception. For example, if the response gets a 204 (No Content), or if the response contains invalid JSON, attempting raises . This wrapper exception provides interoperability for multiple exceptions that may be thrown by different python versions and json serialization libraries. It should be noted that the success of the call to does not indicate the success of the response. Some servers may return a JSON object in a failed response (e.g. error details with HTTP 500). Such JSON will be decoded and returned. To check that a request is successful, use or check is what you expect.\n\nIn the rare case that you’d like to get the raw socket response from the server, you can access . If you want to do this, make sure you set in your initial request. Once you do, you can do this: In general, however, you should use a pattern like this to save what is being streamed to a file: Using will handle a lot of what you would otherwise have to handle when using directly. When streaming a download, the above is the preferred and recommended way to retrieve the content. Note that can be freely adjusted to a number that may better fit your use cases. An important note about using versus . will automatically decode the and transfer-encodings. is a raw stream of bytes – it does not transform the response content. If you really need access to the bytes as they were returned, use .\n\nIf you’d like to add HTTP headers to a request, simply pass in a to the parameter. For example, we didn’t specify our user-agent in the previous example: Note: Custom headers are given less precedence than more specific sources of information. For instance:\n• None Authorization headers set with will be overridden if credentials are specified in , which in turn will be overridden by the parameter. Requests will search for the netrc file at , , or at the path specified by the environment variable.\n• None Authorization headers will be removed if you get redirected off-host.\n• None Proxy-Authorization headers will be overridden by proxy credentials provided in the URL.\n• None Content-Length headers will be overridden when we can determine the length of the content. Furthermore, Requests does not change its behavior at all based on which custom headers are specified. The headers are simply passed on into the final request. Note: All header values must be a , bytestring, or unicode. While permitted, it’s advised to avoid passing unicode header values.\n\nTypically, you want to send some form-encoded data — much like an HTML form. To do this, simply pass a dictionary to the argument. Your dictionary of data will automatically be form-encoded when the request is made: The argument can also have multiple values for each key. This can be done by making either a list of tuples or a dictionary with lists as values. This is particularly useful when the form has multiple elements that use the same key: There are times that you may want to send data that is not form-encoded. If you pass in a instead of a , that data will be posted directly. For example, the GitHub API v3 accepts JSON-Encoded POST/PATCH data: Please note that the above code will NOT add the header (so in particular it will NOT set it to ). If you need that header set and you don’t want to encode the yourself, you can also pass it directly using the parameter (added in version 2.4.2) and it will be encoded automatically: Note, the parameter is ignored if either or is passed.\n\nYou can set the filename, content_type and headers explicitly: If you want, you can send strings to be received as files: In the event you are posting a very large file as a request, you may want to stream the request. By default, does not support this, but there is a separate package which does - . You should read the toolbelt’s documentation for more details about how to use it. For sending multiple files in one request refer to the advanced section. It is strongly recommended that you open files in binary mode. This is because Requests may attempt to provide the header for you, and if it does this value will be set to the number of bytes in the file. Errors may occur if you open the file in text mode.\n\nWe can view the server’s response headers using a Python dictionary: The dictionary is special, though: it’s made just for HTTP headers. According to RFC 7230, HTTP Header names are case-insensitive. So, we can access the headers using any capitalization we want: It is also special in that the server could have sent the same header multiple times with different values, but requests combines them so they can be represented in the dictionary within a single mapping, as per RFC 7230: A recipient MAY combine multiple header fields with the same field name into one “field-name: field-value” pair, without changing the semantics of the message, by appending each subsequent field value to the combined field value in order, separated by a comma.\n\nYou can tell Requests to stop waiting for a response after a given number of seconds with the parameter. Nearly all production code should use this parameter in nearly all requests. Failure to do so can cause your program to hang indefinitely: is not a time limit on the entire response download; rather, an exception is raised if the server has not issued a response for seconds (more precisely, if no bytes have been received on the underlying socket for seconds). If no timeout is specified explicitly, requests do not time out.\n\nIn the event of a network problem (e.g. DNS failure, refused connection, etc), Requests will raise a exception. will raise an if the HTTP request returned an unsuccessful status code. If a request times out, a exception is raised. If a request exceeds the configured number of maximum redirections, a exception is raised. All exceptions that Requests explicitly raises inherit from .

        "document": "The Requests library is the de facto standard for making HTTP requests in Python. It abstracts the complexities of making requests behind a beautiful, simple API so that you can focus on interacting with services and consuming data in your application.\n\nThroughout this tutorial, you’ll see some of the most useful features that Requests has to offer as well as ways to customize and optimize those features for different situations that you may come across. You’ll also learn how to use Requests in an efficient way as well as how to prevent requests to external services from slowing down your application.\n\nIn this tutorial, you’ll learn how to:\n• Make requests using the most common HTTP methods\n• Customize your requests’ headers and data using the query string and message body\n• Inspect data from your requests and responses\n• Configure your requests to help prevent your application from backing up or slowing down\n\nFor the best experience working through this tutorial, you should have basic general knowledge of HTTP. That said, you still may be able to follow along fine without it.\n\nIn the upcoming sections, you’ll see how you can install and use in your application. If you want to play with the code examples that you’ll see in this tutorial, as well as some additional ones, then you can download the code examples and work with them locally:\n\nEven though the Requests library is a common staple for many Python developers, it’s not included in Python’s standard library. There are good reasons for that decision, primarily that the library can continue to evolve more freely as a self-standing project. Note: Requests doesn’t support asynchronous HTTP requests directly. If you need async support in your program, you should try out AIOHTTP or HTTPX. The latter library is broadly compatible with Requests’ syntax. Because Requests is a third-party library, you need to install it before you can use it in your code. As a good practice, you should install external packages into a virtual environment, but you may choose to install into your global environment if you’re planning to use it across multiple projects. Whether you’re working in a virtual environment or not, you’ll need to install : Once has finished installing , you can use it in your application. Importing looks like this: Now that you’re all set up, it’s time to begin your journey through Requests. Your first goal will be learning how to make a request.\n\nA is a powerful object for inspecting the results of the request. Make that same request again, but this time store the return value in a variable so that you can get a closer look at its attributes and behaviors: In this example, you’ve captured the return value of , which is an instance of , and stored it in a variable called . You can now use to see a lot of information about the results of your request. The first bit of information that you can gather from is the status code. A status code informs you of the status of the request. For example, a status means that your request was successful, whereas a status means that the resource you were looking for wasn’t found. There are many other possible status codes as well to give you specific insights into what happened with your request. By accessing , you can see the status code that the server returned: returned , which means that your request was successful and the server responded with the data that you were requesting. Sometimes, you might want to use this information to make decisions in your code: With this logic, if the server returns a status code, then your program will print . If the result is a , then your program will print . Requests goes one step further in simplifying this process for you. If you use a instance in a conditional expression, then it’ll evaluate to if the status code was smaller than , and otherwise. Therefore, you can simplify the last example by rewriting the statement: In the code snippet above, you implicitly check whether the of is between and . If it’s not, then you raise an exception that includes the non-success status code in an f-string. Note: This truth value test is possible because is an overloaded method on . This means that the adapted default behavior of takes the status code into account when determining the truth value of the object. Keep in mind that this method is not verifying that the status code is equal to . The reason for this is that other status codes within the to range, such as and , are also considered successful in the sense that they provide some workable response. For example, the status code tells you that the response was successful, but there’s no content to return in the message body. So, make sure you use this convenient shorthand only if you want to know if the request was generally successful. Then, if necessary, you’ll need to handle the response appropriately based on the status code. Let’s say you don’t want to check the response’s status code in an statement. Instead, you want to use Request’s built-in capacities to raise an exception if the request was unsuccessful. You can do this using : If you invoke , then Requests will raise an for status codes between and . If the status code indicates a successful request, then the program will proceed without raising that exception. Now, you know a lot about how to deal with the status code of the response that you got back from the server. However, when you make a request, you rarely only care about the status code of the response. Usually, you want to see more. Next, you’ll see how to view the actual data that the server sent back in the body of the response. The response of a request often has some valuable information, known as a payload, in the message body. Using the attributes and methods of , you can view the payload in a variety of different formats. To see the response’s content in , you use : While gives you access to the raw bytes of the response payload, you’ll often want to convert them into a string using a character encoding such as UTF-8. will do that for you when you access : Because the decoding of to a requires an encoding scheme, Requests will try to guess the encoding based on the response’s headers if you don’t specify one. You can provide an explicit encoding by setting before accessing : If you take a look at the response, then you’ll see that it’s actually serialized JSON content. To get a dictionary, you could take the that you retrieved from and deserialize it using . However, a simpler way to accomplish this task is to use : The of the return value of is a dictionary, so you can access values in the object by key: You can do a lot with status codes and message bodies. But, if you need more information, like metadata about the response itself, then you’ll need to look at the response’s headers. The response headers can give you useful information, such as the content type of the response payload and a time limit on how long to cache the response. To view these headers, access : returns a dictionary-like object, allowing you to access header values by key. For example, to see the content type of the response payload, you can access : There’s something special about this dictionary-like headers object, though. The HTTP specification defines headers as case-insensitive, which means that you’re able to access these headers without worrying about their capitalization: Whether you use the key or , you’ll get the same value. Now that you’ve seen the most useful attributes and methods of in action, you already have a good overview of Requests’ basic usage. You can get content from the Internet and work with the response that you receive. But there’s more to the Internet than plain and straightforward URLs. In the next section, you’ll take a step back and see how your responses change when you customize your requests to account for query string parameters.\n\nAccording to the HTTP specification, , , and the less common requests pass their data through the message body rather than through parameters in the query string. Using Requests, you’ll pass the payload to the corresponding function’s parameter. takes a dictionary, a list of tuples, bytes, or a file-like object. You’ll want to adapt the data that send in the body of your request to the specific needs of the service that you’re interacting with. For example, if your request’s content type is , then you can send the form data as a dictionary: You can also send that same data as a list of tuples: If, however, you need to send JSON data, then you can use the parameter. When you pass JSON data via , Requests will serialize your data and add the correct header for you. Like you learned earlier, the httpbin service accepts test requests and responds with data about the requests. For instance, you can use it to inspect a basic request: You can see from the response that the server received your request data and headers as you sent them. Requests also provides this information to you in the form of a that you’ll inspect in more detail in the next section.\n\nAuthentication helps a service understand who you are. Typically, you provide your credentials to a server by passing data through the header or a custom header defined by the service. All the functions of Requests that you’ve seen to this point provide a parameter called , which allows you to pass your credentials: The request succeeds if the credentials that you pass in the tuple to are valid. When you pass your credentials in a tuple to the parameter, Requests applies the credentials using HTTP’s Basic access authentication scheme under the hood. You may wonder where the string that Requests set as the value for your header comes from. In short, it’s a Base64-encoded string of the username and password with the prefix :\n• First, Requests combines the username and password that you provided, putting a colon in between them. So for the username and password , this becomes .\n• Then, Requests encodes this string in Base64 using . The encoding converts the string to .\n• Finally, Requests adds in front of this Base64 string. This is how the final value for the header becomes in the example shown above. HTTP Basic authentication isn’t very secure, because you can decode the username and password from the Base64 string. That’s why it’s important to always send these requests over HTTPS, which provides an additional layer of security by encrypting the entire HTTP request. You could make the same request by passing explicit Basic authentication credentials using : Though you don’t need to be explicit for Basic authentication, you may want to authenticate using another method. Requests provides other methods of authentication out of the box, such as and . A real-world example of an API that requires authentication is GitHub’s authenticated user API. This endpoint provides information about the authenticated user’s profile. If you try to make a request without credentials, then you’ll see that the status code is : If you don’t provide authentication credentials when accessing a service that requires them, then you’ll get an HTTP error code as a response. To make a request to GitHub’s authenticated user API, you first need to generate a personal access token with the read:user scope. Then you can pass this token as the second element in a tuple to : Like you learned previously, this approach passes the credentials to , which expects a username and a password and sends the credentials as a Base64-encoded string with the prefix : This works, but it’s not the right way to authenticate with a Bearer token—and using an empty string input for the superfluous username is awkward. With Requests, you can supply your own authentication mechanism to fix that. To try this out, create a subclass of and implement : \"\"\"Attach an API token to the Authorization header.\"\"\" Here, your custom mechanism receives a token, then includes that token in the header of your request, also setting the recommended prefix to the string. You can now use this custom token authentication to make your call to GitHub’s authenticated user API: Your custom created a well-formatted string for the header. You can now use this more intuitive way of interacting with a token-based authentication scheme such as the one that parts of GitHub’s API require. Note: While you could construct the authentication string outside of a custom authentication class and pass it directly with , this appoach is discouraged because it can lead to unexpected behavior. When you attempt to set your authentication credentials directly using , then Requests may internally overwrite your input. This can happen, for example, if you have a file that provides authentication credentials. Requests will attempt to get the credentials from the file if you don’t provide an authentication method using . Bad authentication mechanisms can lead to security vulnerabilities. Unless a service requires a custom authentication mechanism for some reason, you’ll always want to use a tried-and-true auth scheme like the built-in Basic authentication or OAuth, for example through Requests-OAuthlib. While you’re thinking about security, consider dealing with SSL certificates using Requests.\n\nAnytime the data that you’re trying to send or receive is sensitive, security is important. The way that you communicate with secure sites over HTTP is by establishing an encrypted connection using SSL, which means that verifying the target server’s SSL certificate is critical. The good news is that Requests does this for you by default. However, there are some cases where you might want to change this behavior. If you want to disable SSL certificate verification, then you pass to the parameter of the request function: InsecureRequestWarning: Unverified HTTPS request is being made to host Requests even warns you when you’re making an insecure request to help you keep your data safe! Note: Requests uses a package called to provide certificate authorities. This lets Requests know which authorities it can trust. Therefore, you should update frequently to keep your connections as secure as possible. Now that you know how to make all sorts of HTTP requests using Requests, authenticated or not, you may wonder about how you can make sure that your program works as quickly as possible. In the next section, you’ll learn about a few ways that you can improve performance with the help of Requests.\n\nWhen using Requests, especially in a production application environment, it’s important to consider performance implications. Features like timeout control, sessions, and retry limits can help you keep your application running smoothly. When you make an inline request to an external service, your system will need to wait for the response before moving on. If your application waits too long for that response, requests to your service could back up, your user experience could suffer, or your background jobs could hang. By default, Requests will wait indefinitely on the response, so you should almost always specify a timeout duration to prevent these issues from happening. To set the request’s timeout, use the parameter. can be an integer or float representing the number of seconds to wait on a response before timing out: In the first request, the request will time out after 1 second. In the second request, the request will time out after 3.05 seconds. You can also pass a tuple to with the following two elements:\n• Connect timeout: The time it allows for the client to establish a connection to the server\n• Read timeout: The time it’ll wait on a response once your client has established a connection Both of these elements should be numbers, and can be of type or : If the request establishes a connection within 3.05 seconds and receives data within 5 seconds of the connection being established, then the response will be returned as it was before. If the request times out, then the function will raise a exception: \"The request did not time out\" Your program can catch the exception and respond accordingly. Until now, you’ve been dealing with high-level APIs such as and . These functions are abstractions of what’s going on when you make your requests. They hide implementation details, such as how connections are managed, so that you don’t have to worry about them. Underneath those abstractions is a class called . If you need to fine-tune your control over how requests are being made or improve the performance of your requests, you may need to use a instance directly. Sessions are used to persist parameters across requests. For example, if you want to use the same authentication across multiple requests, then you can use a session: In this code example, you use a context manager to ensure that the session releases the resources when it doesn’t need them anymore. In line 7, you log in using your custom . You only need to log in once per session, and then you can make multiple authenticated requests. Requests will persist the credentials while the session exists. You then make two requests to the authenticated user API in lines 9 and 10 using instead of . The primary performance optimization of sessions comes in the form of persistent connections. When your app makes a connection to a server using a , it keeps that connection around in a connection pool. When your app wants to connect to the same server again, it’ll reuse a connection from the pool rather than establishing a new one. When a request fails, you may want your application to retry the same request. However, Requests won’t do this for you by default. To apply this functionality, you need to implement a custom transport adapter. Transport adapters let you define a set of configurations for each service that you’re interacting with. For example, say you want all requests to to retry two times before finally raising a . You’d build a transport adapter, set its parameter, and mount it to an existing : In this example, you’ve set up your session so that it’ll retry a maximum of two times when your request to GitHub’s API doesn’t work as expected. When you mount the —in this case, —to , then will adhere to its configuration for each request to . Note: While the implementation shown above works, you won’t see any effect of the retry behavior unless there’s something wrong with your network connection or GitHub’s servers. If you want to play around with code that builds on top of this example, and you’d like to inspect when the retries happen, then you’re in luck. You can download the materials of this tutorial and take a look at : Get Your Code: Click here to download the free sample code that shows you how to use Python’s Requests library. The code in this file improves on the example shown above by using the underlying to further customize the retry functionality. It also adds logging to display debugging output, which gives you a chance to monitor when Python attempted the retries. Requests comes packaged with intuitive implementations for timeouts, transport adapters, and sessions that can help you keep your code efficient and your application resilient."

This path is defined as the number of edges between the nodes, so the challenge lies in efficiently calculating this longest path while traversing the tree. 💡💡My Approach: I approached the problem using depth-first search (DFS) to calculate the depth of the left and right subtrees for each node recursively. ➡During this process, I continuously updated the maximum diameter by summing the depths of the left and right subtrees for each node. ➡The final diameter is the maximum path length found throughout the traversal. 🌟🌟Key Takeaways: ➡Recursion is powerful for traversing tree structures. Using DFS allowed me to explore the tree efficiently while keeping track of key values (left and right subtree depths). ➡Global variables are useful for tracking cumulative data, like the maximum diameter across all recursive calls. ➡Binary tree problems offer valuable insights into optimizing recursive solutions, especially when calculating depth-related properties. #LeetCode #100daysofcodechallenge #Coding #learning #datastructures #problemsolving #programming #CodingCommunity #AlgorithmChallenges #Java #Tech #Developer #LinkedInChallenge #DailyCoding"

But I have a very basic knowledge of web frontend, so at first I avoid that. I know that I can easily manage to build the Backend as well as RestAPI endpoints. But for the front end, I need someone to build that.🤔\n\nAs I have very very less friends in my contact (apparently have 16k+ followers on LinkedIn 😂) and specifically need a frontend peep. ya got one friend who can easily do this and we can make it possible to live immediately within 1/2 days as she has prior knowledge about webdev.\n\nwatch some beginning stories, how it actually started 🥲🙂\n\nI told everything that we wanna build and what type of frontend UI we required. Then, both of us started working, I was in the backend to build the APIs endpoint and she started building the front end. 🚀.\n\nThe deadline was: 24 hours 🙂, ya set our deadline within 24 hours to submit our work in front of each other.\n\nand we finished, then after slight modifications, we launched 🥂.\n\nLike, we talked Thursday night and launched on Sunday 😁.\n\nAnd, ya final website was launched at 6:30 AM and we started sharing the same at the End of the day.\n\nHehe, how the story started and now reached at 5,300+ users 😁.\n\nWe used normal HTML, and CSS to develop the Website and to build the Backend means API endpoint, we used Python Flask and hosted at Cyclic.\n\nAnd in the website, we used JavaScript to implement the functionality.\n\nThat time (because right now we majorly modified LeetCode Wrapped) our API gives these responses by entering the userName.\n\nRight now, the code behind this is not public. We will soon change the private repo to a public one.\n• Active users from 15+ countries, including the USA, Canada, Bangladesh, Russia, Kyrgyzstan, etc.\n• within 30 minutes of launching, we achieved 150+ users.\n\n5. Modifications we did later:\n\nYes, Now the 𝗟𝗲𝗲𝘁𝗖𝗼𝗱𝗲𝗪𝗿𝗮𝗽𝗽𝗲𝗱 is not bounded to only 2023 Summary stats of Your LeetCode Journey… 😲\n\n⚙️ 𝗙𝗲𝘄 𝗠𝗼𝗱𝗶𝗳𝗶𝗰𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀: \n\n - On the stats page now there will be the years, in which you active on LeetCode\n\n - also byDefault the “Overall” option will open, then you can switch to any Year you want\n\n - At the time of switching to years, it will not take any time or loading to show the data, seamlessly you can switch\n\n(as we received lots of requests regarding this, so finally It’s live)\n\nHope every point crystal clear. So, why are you guys waiting, let’s check out the website and feel free to share your views. We are expecting your feedback. Whatever you feel, just share it with us so that we can improve… 💬"
