At least one An example using a pre-defined color and a hexadecimal color code: {display:{Name:'{\"text\":\"Tunic of Destiny\",\"color\":\"blue\",...}',Lore:['{\"text\":\"A magical blue tunic\"}','{\"text\":\"worn by the gods...\"}',color:'#3C44AA']}} Can be used to add attributes to mobs or items. For more information, see Attribute. Used to make items with durability that never degrades. Used for getting player heads. Used to hide flags (the info in the tool tip) such as enchantments, CanDestroy, CanPlaceOn, etc. To hide multiple tags, you need to add the value of the tags you want to hide. For example, if you want to hide the \"Enchantments\" and the \"Attributes modifiers\" tags, the value you need to put is 3 (1+2).

        "document": "How to Edit NBT Files in Minecraft\n\nWhen playing Minecraft on a server with friends or a solo world in singleplayer, we very rarely spend time thinking about how the game keeps track of data. Whether it’s the world settings itself or a player’s inventory, this information is kept in various files that are often inaccessible to most people. This is no longer the case thanks to a tool called NBTExplorer, which allows you to view and edit any world’s data files. Whether you want to locate a player or want to know how to disable hardcore mode, this all achievable with this program. This process can be very confusing for first-time users, so we have created this Apex Hosting tutorial to help you get started.\n• Press the tab to the far-right to access all downloads.\n• Under the area for the latest release, download the NBTExplorer .zip file.\n• Extract the .zip contents inside of an easily-accessible folder.\n• Launch the file to open the application.\n\nBefore you start editing any NBT data, we recommend locating the desired file, then downloading or making a copy of it to your desktop or other safe location. This can help revert any changes you make in the event of an error.\n• Navigate to your Apex Server panel, then stop the server.\n• Enter the in the left-hand menu, then log in.\n• Locate your desired world folder and click to enter its subdirectory.\n• Open your Minecraft launcher, then proceed to the tab at the top.\n• Hover over your gameplay profile, then press the icon to the right.\n• In the new window, enter the folder, followed by your world file.\n• Like before, locate either the or a .dat file from the folder.\n• Copy this file to a separate location, such as the desktop.\n\nWith your files safely stored on your device, you’re ready to begin using the NBTExplorer app. To start, simply drag + drop your desired file into the program to open it. Alternatively, go to File > Open, then select your .dat file through there.\n\nWhen adjusting a level.dat file for a world, there will be plenty of sub-menus and values to edit. While many of them are straight forward based on the name alone, we recommend only editing necessary values to prevent any issues. Some of these notable ones include:\n\nGameRules: Want to adjust the gamerules without using any in-game commands? By expanding the dropdown you can manually adjust every rule to your liking.\n\nAllowCommands: This option allows you to permanently enable or disable cheats on a world. This can be especially useful if you created a world but forgot to enable cheats at the beginning.\n\nDifficulty: Similar to the gamerules, this allows you to manually adjust the difficulty option of a world, regardless of cheat command access in-game. This can be beneficial if the difficulty has been locked on the world.\n\nDifficultyLocked: Do you regret locking the difficulty on the world but don’t want to use any commands to bypass it? Adjusting this value will unlock the difficulty of your world, allowing for easy adjustment on singleplayer once again.\n\nHardcore: Whether it was created by accident or not, dealing with a hardcore world can become stressful after a while. Thankfully, a quick change to the value will remove this limitation from your world and restore normal gameplay.\n\nLevelName: Ever tried to rename a Minecraft folder name and noticed it doesn’t change in the singleplayer world selection? That’s because of this data string, which can be adjusted to reflect a new name regardless of what the original folder is titled.\n\n\n\nSimilar to the level.dat world data, player data can also be important and changes as well. There are many more data strings available, but many of them may cause issues when changed so we advise proceeding with caution. Some notable adjustments are:\n\nAbilities: Under the category of the same name, the data allows you to adjust a player’s walkspeed, whether they can fly, build, are invulnerable, and more.\n\nInventory: While it’s far from the most effective way of achieving it, the section allows you to see the contents of any player’s inventory, as well as the amount. Alternatively, it can be used to modify the inventory directly.\n\nPosition: Trying to find a player or their base? By checking the dropdown, you can view their position coordinates in the world. If necessary, this can be combined with the data if they are not located in the overworld.\n\nHealth/Food: As the name suggests, the and data strings control the character’s fullness and hearts. 20 is a full bar, while 0 is completely empty.\n\n\n\nWith your changes made and saved, you can now replace the existing file on either your client or server. We highly recommend making an additional backup, which is reflected in the steps below:\n• Return to your world or playerdata folder on the client/server from earlier.\n• Select the original .dat file, then rename it to end with .\n• If present, select and delete the matching .dat.old file as well. \n\n For servers: Press the button in the top-left, then drag + drop your edited .dat file. Once at 100%, verify it was uploaded correctly, then start the server. For singleplayer: Copy + paste or move the edited .dat file into the necessary folder. Once it is done, you may start your game and launch the world.\n\nThe changes did not work:\n\nIf the desired changes didn’t take effect, there are many potential reasons this may occur. First, verify that you are saving your adjusted .dat file and properly uploading it back to the original world folder in the correct location. If the file is uploaded anywhere else, it will not take effect. Additionally, verify that you are changing the correct file and attribute, or you may not notice the changes as intended. Once you have performed these checks and reuploaded the file, restart the game and try again.\n\nHow to restore the original NBT .dat file:\n\nWhether you made a mistake or simply want to revert all your changes, this will be easy to do as long as you perform the above steps correctly. To do this, stop the server/game and return to your .dat file location. Delete or move the current file, then rename the file to just . Afterwards, delete the .dat.old file as well and restart the game. This should return your file back to the original. Keep in mind that performing these steps on a player data file will also revert that player’s position and inventory."

Be aware that using a hexadecimal color value needs a # (comment sign) before the code, which makes the whole value a string. For more information of usable pre-defined colors, see Color codes. A custom RGB color mixer can be found here. At least one An example using a pre-defined color and a hexadecimal color code: {display:{Name:'{\"text\":\"Tunic of Destiny\",\"color\":\"blue\",...}',Lore:['{\"text\":\"A magical blue tunic\"}','{\"text\":\"worn by the gods...\"}',color:'#3C44AA']}} Can be used to add attributes to mobs or items. For more information, see Attribute. Used to make items with durability that never degrades. Used for getting player heads. Used to hide flags (the info in the tool tip) such as enchantments, CanDestroy, CanPlaceOn, etc. To hide multiple tags, you need to add the value of the tags you want to hide. For example, if you want to hide the \"Enchantments\" and the \"Attributes modifiers\" tags, the value you need to put is 3 (1+2). The value ranges from 1 to 255, representing 255 combinations or 8 binary digits.[1] When adding to create a unique value: Adding 32 hides other information, including potion effects, shield pattern info, \"StoredEnchantments\", written book \"generation\" and \"author\", \"Explosion\", \"Fireworks\", and map tooltips This tag is used when making adventure maps to allow a specific tool/item to break a block.

The duration before an item disappears. Any number. Set to -32768 for items that don't disappear. If Age counts up to 6000 (5 minutes if Age started at default value 0), the item disappears. Defines whether a written book is labeled as an \"Original\", a \"Copy of Original\", a \"Copy of a copy\" or \"Tattered\". At least one defines the author of a written_book. Can be hidden by using An array that defines the pages of a written_book. Note that for the book to properly display the text, a title and an author must also be provided, otherwise the book will display the message At least one {pages:['{\"text\":\"Any json text can be used here!\"}','{\"text\":\"Page 2!\"}']} Used when giving yourself firework rockets, this value defines what the rocket will do when launched: color, flight duration, shape, etc. At least one\n\nThe following table describes more details on Enchantments sub-tag.\n\nThe following table describes more details on display sub-tag.\n\nOne can further modify the text with things like italics and boldness like so:\n\nThe following table describes more details on the Fireworks sub-tag.\n\nThese tags are put on blocks as items.\n\nThese tags are used when using the command to spawn entities or when using the to edit the data of entities.\n\nUsed to store all data kept within a block. Mainly used within blocks that can store items or contain various data values, e.g., Command blocks, Chests, Jukeboxes, Dispenser, Beacon, etc. Determines the initial velocity of most entities (all other than Dragon Fireballs, Fireballs, Small Fireballs and Wither Skulls) upon being summoned. Must be entered as double precision floating point values (decimals). Example: {Motion:[0.0,1.0,0.0]} summons with an initial upward velocity of 1.0. The values could be only -10 to 10, because it could have been to be moved very fast. It normally could lead to a wall clip. Similar to Motion, determines the initial velocity of Dragon Fireballs, Fireballs, Small Fireballs, and Wither Skulls upon being summoned. This tag is required to summon said entities, otherwise the command fails. Example: {direction:[0.0,1.0,0.0]} summons with an initial upward velocity of 1.0. This tag determines only the entity's velocity, not the direction that it's facing. Similar to direction, but determines constant acceleration. Example: {power:[0.0,1.0,0.0]} gives the summoned entity a constant upward acceleration of 1.0. Entities are still affected by drag when power is nonzero and eventually reaches a terminal velocity. Affects only Dragon Fireballs, Fireballs, Small Fireballs, and Wither Skulls. Sets the effects that apply to a mob after it is summoned. Type -1 to apply its countdown to infinity. It should hide its numbers to *. Controls villagers giving xp for trading, set to true or false. Normally, villagers can reward you experience orbs. Sets which entities are riding on top of the base entity. Allows multiple entities to ride one base entity. Riding entities are still able to do all stuff they have coded.

Items go in slots Feet, Legs, Chest, Head, in that order. Defines what item is within the mainhand and offhand. First item is the mainhand, second is offhand. Determines how likely it is for an entity to drop held Items. The tag Count in the equipment tag must be 1 or greater for this to work. 2 separate float values, one for the main hand and one for the off-hand slot. 0.0-1.0 determines likelihood of dropping, but applies a random durability if it does. Anything greater than 1.0 makes it always drop with full durability. Since it is a float value, it must be phrased as \"X.Y\", with X and Y being values of your choice. Determines how likely it is for an entity to drop worn Items. The tag Count in the equipment tag must be 1 or greater for this to work. 4 separate float values, one for each slot. 0.0-1.0 determines likelihood of dropping, but applies a random durability if it does. Anything greater than 1.0 makes it always drop with full durability. Since it is a float value, it must be phrased as \"X.Y\", with X and Y being values of your choice.
