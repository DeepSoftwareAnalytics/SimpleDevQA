        "document": "Go Up to Data Types, Variables, and Constants Index\n\nA pointer is a variable that denotes a memory address. When a pointer holds the address of another variable, we say that it points to the location of that variable in memory or to the data stored there. In the case of an array or other structured type, a pointer holds the address of the first element in the structure. If that address is already taken, then the pointer holds the address to the first element.\n\nPointers are typed to indicate the kind of data stored at the addresses they hold. The general-purpose Pointer type can represent a pointer to any data, while more specialized pointer types reference only specific types of data. The PByte type is used for any byte data that is not character data.\n\nOn 32-bit platforms, a pointer occupies four bytes of memory as a 32-bit address. On 64-bit platforms, a pointer occupies eight bytes of memory as a 64-bit address.\n\nThis topic contains information on the following:\n• Declaring and using the pointer types supported by Delphi.\n\nTo see how pointers work, look at the following example:\n\nLine 2 declares X and Y as variables of type Integer. Line 3 declares P as a pointer to an Integer value; this means that P can point to the location of X or Y. Line 5 assigns a value to X, and line 6 assigns the address of X (denoted by @X) to P. Finally, line 7 retrieves the value at the location pointed to by P (denoted by ^P) and assigns it to Y. After this code executes, X and Y have the same value, namely 17.\n\nThe @ operator, which is used here to take the address of a variable, also operates on functions and procedures. For more information, see The @ Operator and Procedural Types in Statements and Expressions.\n\nThe caret symbol ^ has two purposes, both of which are illustrated in our example. When it appears before a type identifier:\n\nthe caret symbol denotes a type that represents pointers to variables of type .\n\nWhen the caret symbol appears after a variable:\n\nthe caret dereferences the ; that is, it returns the value stored at the memory address held by the .\n\nThis example might seem like a roundabout way of copying the value of one variable to another - something that we could have accomplished with a simple assignment statement. But pointers are useful for several reasons. First, understanding pointers will help you to understand the Delphi language, since pointers often operate behind the scenes in code where they don't appear explicitly. Any data type that requires large, dynamically allocated blocks of memory uses pointers. Long-string variables, for instance, are implicitly pointers, as are class instance variables. Moreover, some advanced programming techniques require the use of pointers.\n\nFinally, pointers are sometimes the only way to circumvent Delphi's strict data typing. By referencing a variable with an all-purpose Pointer, casting the Pointer to a more specific type, and then dereferencing it, you can treat the data stored by any variable as if it belonged to any type. For example, the following code assigns data stored in a real variable to an integer variable:\n\nOf course, reals and integers are stored in different formats. This assignment simply copies raw binary data from R to I, without converting it.\n\nIn addition to assigning the result of an @ operation, you can use several standard routines to give a value to a pointer. The New and GetMem procedures assign a memory address to an existing pointer, while the Addr and Ptr functions return a pointer to a specified address or variable.\n\nDereferenced pointers can be qualified and can function as qualifiers, as in the expression P1^.Data^.\n\nThe reserved word nil is a special constant that can be assigned to any pointer. When nil is assigned to a pointer, the pointer doesn't reference anything.\n\nThe {$EXTENDED} compiler directive affects the use of the caret (^). When {$X+} is in effect (the default), you can omit the caret when referencing pointers. The caret is still required when declaring a pointer and for resolving the ambiguity when a pointer points to another pointer. For more information, see Extended syntax (Delphi).\n\nWith extended syntax enabled, you can omit the caret when referring to a pointer, as in the following example:\n\nWhen extended syntax is not enabled, the line marked {#1} would typically be expressed as:\n\nYou can declare a pointer to any type, using the syntax:\n\nWhen you define a record or other data type, it might be useful to also define a pointer to that type. This makes it easy to manipulate instances of the type without copying large blocks of memory.\n\nNote: You can declare a pointer type before you declare the type it points to.\n\nStandard pointer types exist for many purposes. The most versatile is Pointer, which can point to data of any kind. But a Pointer variable cannot be dereferenced; placing the ^ symbol after a Pointer variable causes a compilation error. To access the data referenced by a Pointer variable, first cast it to another pointer type and then dereference it.\n\nThe fundamental types PAnsiChar and PWideChar represent pointers to AnsiChar and WideChar values, respectively. The generic PChar represents a pointer to a Char (that is, in its current implementation, to a WideChar). These character pointers are used to manipulate null-terminated strings. (See \"Working with null-terminated strings\" in String Types (Delphi).)\n\nThe fundamental type PByte represents a pointer to any byte data that is not character data. This type is declared with the compiler directive:\n\nThe $T compiler directive controls the types of pointer values generated by the @ operator. This directive takes the form of:\n\nIn the {$T-} state, the result type of the @ operator is always an untyped pointer that is compatible with all other pointer types. When @ is applied to a variable reference in the {$T+} state, the type of the result is ^T, where T is compatible only with pointers to the type of the variable.\n\nThe and units declare many standard pointer types that are commonly used.\n\nUse the directive to turn pointer arithmetic on or off for all typed pointers, so that increment/decrement is by element size."

They allowed direct access to memory, enabling complex data structures to be built and navigated. \n\n However, with the advent of Object Orientation, things have changed somewhat. For example, the TStringList class allows a list of strings to be built without the user needing to manage the storage. And hence, removing the need to use pointers to do this. \n\n Additionally, the Pascal language has also evolved to avoid dynamic storage management by coders - for example with the advent of dynamic arrays. You can now simply code a SetLength call to set or increase the size of such an array as your program runs. \n\n However, there are still some situations where pointers are valid in Delphi. \n\n Pointers are a special type of variable. Like a meta-variable. They can point to other variables, or to memory. You might use a record pointer, for example, to point to a block of memory where you have stored lots of record data. You would then use the pointer just as if it were a record variable. We'll see how below. \n\n When calling Windows APIs (Application Programmer Interfaces), we are obliged to use pointers. \n\n Delphi provides a number of typed pointer types, such as PChar, and PExtended, along with a generic, 'point to anything' type - the Pointer type. \n\n The nice thing about the typed pointers is that they work sensibly with the Inc and Dec functions. Incrementing an PInt64 pointer will add SizeOf(Int64) bytes to the pointer address so that it points to the next Int64 variable in memory. \n\n The Pointer type is a dangerous one - it falls foul of Delphi's normally tight type handling. Use it with care, or you will end up addressing the wrong memory. \n\n The PChar type can be used to scan along a string : \n\n var \n\n myString : string; \n\n myCharPtr : PChar; \n\n i : Integer; \n\n \n\n begin \n\n \n\n myString := 'Hello World'; \n\n \n\n // Point to the first character in the string \n\n i := 1; \n\n myCharPtr := Addr(myString[i]); \n\n \n\n // Display all characters in the string \n\n while i <= Length(myString) do \n\n begin \n\n ShowMessage(myCharPtr^); // Display the string characters one by one \n\n Inc(i); \n\n Inc(myCharPtr); \n\n end; \n\n end; \n\n \n\n There are two things to note here. First the use of Addr function to get the address of the string. You could equally use the @ operator. Pointers always work with addresses - the address of a variable here, or a block of acquired memory. Here we point the PChar value to the first character in the string. \n\n Secondly, now that we have a pointer, we use the ^ character at the end of the pointer name to refer to what the pointer points to. In this case, a character. \n\n A PChar^ will always give us a character. A PInt64^, for example, will give us an Int64 value. This is where the typing comes in. \n\n You can define a pointer to any data type using a different technique: \n\n Here, the ^ symbol is used to dereference the type - we are saying that we do not have a TMyRecord type, but a pointer to one. Note that this is a prefix use of ^. \n\n Let us create a full record example : \n\n When we simpy refer to the record field name, without a ^, Delphi is in fact adding one for us - it recognises what we are doing, and helps us make for more readable code. \n\n In this example, we'll build a new class that is a limited number list equivalent to the TStringList class. This class will allow you to keep adding numbers to a list of numbers. \n\n The class uses pointers to help store the numbers in a block of memory, reallocating this block when it is all used up. \n\n First off, we will look at the constructor : \n\n var \n\n msCount : Integer; // Count of numbers in the list \n\n maxCount : Integer; // Maximum numbers that can fit into current storage \n\n memStart : Pointer; // Start of the memory holding the list \n\n nextSlot : PInt64; // Points to the next free slot in memory \n\n \n\n const \n\n ALLOCATE_SIZE = 20; // How many numbers to store in first memory block \n\n \n\n // Constructor - initialise everything \n\n constructor TNumberList.Create; \n\n begin \n\n msCount := 0; // No numbers in the list yet \n\n \n\n \n\n GetMem(memStart, ALLOCATE_SIZE * SizeOf(Int64)); \n\n \n\n // Indicate how many numbers that we can add before acquiring more memory \n\n maxCount := ALLOCATE_SIZE; \n\n \n\n // And point to the next free memory slot - the first! \n\n nextSlot := memStart; \n\n end; \n\n \n\n The role of the constructor is to initialise the class. The key part of this is to allocate a block of memory that can hold 20 numbers. We'll use Int64 numbers (for some reason, Delphi does not provide an Integer pointer). \n\n The GetMem call allocates storage of the desired size, setting the memStart generalised Pointer variable to the starting address of the memory allocated. Note that GetMem insists on a Pointer variable. \n\n We'll add a routine to add a value to the memory : \n\n // Add a number to the list \n\n procedure TNumberList.Add(const number : Int64); \n\n begin \n\n // Store the number at the next slot in our memory block \n\n nextSlot^ := number; \n\n \n\n \n\n Inc(msCount); \n\n Inc(nextSlot); \n\n end; \n\n \n\n The passed number is stored in the next Int64 slot in our memory block, and this nextSlot pointer incremented. Note that this adds SizeOf(Int64) bytes to the address value in this pointer, because the Inc call knows the type of this pointer. \n\n And here is a routine for retrieving a value : \n\n // Get the number at the index position (starting at 0) \n\n function TNumberList.GetValue(index : Integer): Int64; \n\n var \n\n numberPtr : PInt64; \n\n begin \n\n // Simply get the value at the given Int64 index position \n\n numberPtr := memStart; \n\n Inc(numberPtr, index); // Point to the index'th Int64 number in storage \n\n Result := numberPtr^; // And get the Int64 number it points to \n\n end; \n\n \n\n Here we use Inc to add index Int64 size bytes to the start of memory to get to the slot of the required memory. \n\n However, we have not yet covered the situation where the memory we allocate is all used up. We will extend the Add routine to do just this : \n\n // Add a number to the list \n\n procedure TNumberList.Add(const number : Int64); \n\n var \n\n newMemoryStart : Pointer; \n\n oldPtr, newPtr : PInt64; \n\n i : Integer; \n\n begin \n\n // If we do not have enough space to add the number, then get more space! \n\n if msCount = maxCount then \n\n begin \n\n \n\n GetMem(newMemoryStart, (maxCount + ALLOCATE_SIZE) * SizeOf(Int64)); \n\n \n\n // Copy the data from the old memory here \n\n oldPtr := memStart; \n\n newPtr := newMemoryStart; \n\n for i := 1 to maxCount do \n\n begin \n\n \n\n newPtr^ := oldPtr^; \n\n Inc(oldPtr); \n\n Inc(newPtr); \n\n end; \n\n \n\n \n\n FreeMem(memStart); \n\n \n\n // And now refer to the new memory \n\n memStart := newMemoryStart; \n\n nextSlot := memStart; \n\n Inc(nextSlot, maxCount); \n\n Inc(maxCount, ALLOCATE_SIZE); \n\n end; \n\n \n\n // Now we can safely add the number to the list \n\n nextSlot^ := number; \n\n \n\n \n\n Inc(msCount); \n\n Inc(nextSlot); \n\n end; \n\n \n\n Here we abandon our old memory block (Delphi cannot let us extend the size of it), and create a bigger one. Having allocated it, we must copy the old memory contents to it. Here we see a new concept - assigning the value referred by one pointer to the contents of memory pointed to by another. Delphi knows to copy the whole Int64 value rather than just one byte because these are PInt64 pointers. \n\n Below is the full code of the class : \n\n unit NumberList; \n\n \n\n interface \n\n \n\n type \n\n TNumberList = class \n\n \n\n private \n\n msCount : Integer; // Count of numbers in the list \n\n maxCount : Integer; // Maximum numbers that can fit into current storage \n\n memStart : Pointer; // Start of the memory holding the list \n\n nextSlot : PInt64; // Points to the next free slot in memory \n\n \n\n function GetValue(index : Integer) : Int64; \n\n \n\n public \n\n property Items[index : Integer] : Int64 \n\n read GetValue; default; // Default means we can use the list[i] \n\n \n\n published \n\n constructor Create; \n\n destructor Destroy; override; \n\n procedure Add(const number : Int64); \n\n \n\n property Count : Integer \n\n read msCount; \n\n end; \n\n \n\n implementation \n\n \n\n const \n\n ALLOCATE_SIZE = 20; // How many numbers to store in first memory block \n\n \n\n // Constructor - initialise everything \n\n constructor TNumberList.Create; \n\n begin \n\n msCount := 0; // No numbers in the list yet \n\n \n\n \n\n GetMem(memStart, ALLOCATE_SIZE * SizeOf(Int64)); \n\n \n\n // Indicate how many numbers that we can add before acquiring more memory \n\n maxCount := ALLOCATE_SIZE; \n\n \n\n // And point to the next free memory slot - the first! \n\n nextSlot := memStart; \n\n end; \n\n \n\n // Destructor - release storage obtained \n\n destructor TNumberList.Destroy; \n\n begin \n\n \n\n FreeMem(memStart); \n\n \n\n \n\n inherited; \n\n end; \n\n \n\n // Add a number to the list \n\n procedure TNumberList.Add(const number : Int64); \n\n var \n\n newMemoryStart : Pointer; \n\n oldPtr, newPtr : PInt64; \n\n i : Integer; \n\n begin \n\n // If we do not have enough space to add the number, then get more space! \n\n if msCount = maxCount then \n\n begin \n\n \n\n GetMem(newMemoryStart, (maxCount + ALLOCATE_SIZE) * SizeOf(Int64)); \n\n \n\n // Copy the data from the old memory here \n\n oldPtr := memStart; \n\n newPtr := newMemoryStart; \n\n for i := 1 to maxCount do \n\n begin \n\n \n\n newPtr^ := oldPtr^; \n\n Inc(oldPtr); \n\n Inc(newPtr); \n\n end; \n\n \n\n \n\n FreeMem(memStart); \n\n \n\n // And now refer to the new memory \n\n memStart := newMemoryStart; \n\n nextSlot := memStart; \n\n Inc(nextSlot, maxCount); \n\n Inc(maxCount, ALLOCATE_SIZE); \n\n end; \n\n \n\n // Now we can safely add the number to the list \n\n nextSlot^ := number; \n\n \n\n \n\n Inc(msCount); \n\n Inc(nextSlot); \n\n end; \n\n \n\n // Get the number at the index position (starting at 0) \n\n function TNumberList.GetValue(index : Integer): Int64; \n\n var \n\n numberPtr : PInt64; \n\n begin \n\n // Simply get the value at the given Int64 index position \n\n numberPtr := memStart; \n\n Inc(numberPtr, index); // Point to the index'th Int64 number in storage \n\n Result := numberPtr^; // And get the Int64 number it points to \n\n end; \n\n \n\n end. \n\n \n\n And here is how the code could be used : \n\n var \n\n list : TNumberList; \n\n value : Int64; \n\n i : Integer; \n\n begin \n\n \n\n list := TNumberList.Create; \n\n \n\n // Add the first 30 even numbers to the list, each doubled in size \n\n for i := 0 to 29 do \n\n list.Add(i * 2); \n\n \n\n // Get the 22nd value = 44 (22 * 2) \n\n value := list[22]; \n\n ShowMessage('22nd value = '+IntToStr(value)); \n\n end;"

        "document": "Even though pointers aren't as important in Delphi as they are in C or C++, they're such a \"basic\" tool that almost anything having to do with programming must deal with pointers in some fashion.\n\nIt's for that reason that you might read about how a string or object is really just a pointer, or that an event handler such as OnClick, is actually a pointer to a procedure.\n\nSimply put, a pointer is a variable that holds the address of anything in memory.\n\nTo concrete this definition, keep in mind that everything used by an application is stored somewhere in the computer's memory. Because a pointer holds the address of another variable, it's said to point to that variable.\n\nMost of the time, pointers in Delphi point to a specific type:\n\nThe syntax to declare a pointer data type uses a caret (^). In the above code, iValue is an integer type variable and pIntValue is an integer type pointer. Since a pointer is nothing more than an address in memory, we must assign to it the location (address) of the value stored in the iValue integer variable.\n\nThe @ operator returns the address of a variable (or a function or procedure as will be seen below). Equivalent to the @ operator is Addr function. Note that pIntValue's value is not 2001.\n\nIn this sample code, pIntValue is a typed integer pointer. Good programming style is to use typed pointers as much as you can. The Pointer data type is a generic pointer type; it represents a pointer to any data.\n\nNote that when \"^\" appears after a pointer variable, it de-references the pointer; that is, it returns the value stored at the memory address held by the pointer. In this example, variable j has the same value as iValue. It might look like this has no purpose when we can simply assign iValue to j, but this piece of code lies behind most calls to Win API.\n\nUnassigned pointers are dangerous. Since pointers let us work directly with computer's memory, if we try to (by mistake) write to a protected location in memory, we could get an access violation error. This is the reason we should always initialize a pointer to NIL.\n\nNIL is a special constant that can be assigned to any pointer. When nil is assigned to a pointer, the pointer doesn’t reference anything. Delphi presents, for example, an empty dynamic array or a long string as a nil pointer.\n\nThe fundamental types PAnsiChar and PWideChar represent pointers to AnsiChar and WideChar values. The generic PChar represents a pointer to a Char variable.\n\nThese character pointers are used to manipulate null-terminated strings. Think of a PChar as being a pointer to a null-terminated string or to the array that represents one.\n\nWhen we define a record or other data type, it's a common practice also to define a pointer to that type. This makes it easy to manipulate instances of the type without copying large blocks of memory.\n\nThe ability to have pointers to records (and arrays) makes it much easier to set up complicated data structures as linked lists and trees.\n\nThe idea behind linked lists is to give us the possibility to store the address to the next linked item in a list inside a NextItem record field.\n\nPointers to records can also be used when storing custom data for every tree view item, for example.\n\nAnother important pointer concept in Delphi is procedure and method pointers.\n\nPointers that point to the address of a procedure or function are called procedural pointers. Method pointers are similar to procedure pointers. However, instead of pointing to standalone procedures, they must point to class methods.\n\nMethod pointer is a pointer that contains information about both the name and object that's being invoked.\n\nThe most common use for pointers in Delphi is interfacing to C and C++ code, which includes accessing the Windows API.\n\nWindows API functions use a number of data types that might be unfamiliar to the Delphi programmer. Most of the parameters in calling API functions are pointers to some data type. As stated above, we use null-terminated strings in Delphi when calling Windows API functions.\n\nIn many cases, when an API call returns a value in a buffer or pointer to a data structure, these buffers and data structures must be allocated by the application before the API call is made. The SHBrowseForFolder Windows API function is one example.\n\nThe real power of pointers comes from the ability to set aside memory while the program is executing.\n\nThis piece of code should be enough to prove that working with pointers is not as hard as it might seem at first. It's used to change the text (caption) of the control with the Handle provided."

        "document": "Go Up to Data Types, Variables, and Constants Index\n\nSimple types - which include ordinal types and real types - define ordered sets of values.\n\nOrdinal types include integer, character, Boolean, enumerated, and subrange types. An ordinal type defines an ordered set of values in which each value except the first has a unique predecessor and each value except the last has a unique successor. Further, each value has an ordinality, which determines the ordering of the type. In most cases, if a value has ordinality n, its predecessor has ordinality n-1 and its successor has ordinality n+1.\n\nFor integer types, the ordinality of a value is the value itself. Subrange types maintain the ordinalities of their base types. For other ordinal types, by default the first value has ordinality 0, the next value has ordinality 1, and so forth. The declaration of an enumerated type can explicitly override this default.\n\nSeveral predefined functions operate on ordinal values and type identifiers. The most important of them are summarized below.\n\n\n\n For example, High(Byte) returns 255 because the highest value of type Byte is 255, and Succ(2) returns 3 because 3 is the successor of 2.\n\nThe standard procedures Inc and Dec increment and decrement the value of an ordinal variable. For example, Inc(I) is equivalent to and, if is an integer variable, to .\n\nAn integer type represents a subset of the integral numbers.\n\nInteger types can be platform-dependent and platform-independent.\n\nThe platform-dependent integer types are transformed to fit the bit size of the current compiler platform. The platform-dependent integer types are NativeInt, NativeUInt, LongInt, and LongWord. Using these types whenever possible, since they result in the best performance for the underlying CPU and operating system, is desirable. The following table illustrates their ranges and storage formats for the Delphi compiler.\n\nPlatform-independent integer types always have the same size, regardless of what platform you use. Platform-independent integer types include ShortInt, SmallInt, LongInt, Integer, Int64, Byte, Word, LongWord, Cardinal, and UInt64.\n\n\n\n In general, arithmetic operations on integers return a value of type Integer, which is equivalent to the 32-bit LongInt. Operations return a value of type Int64 only when performed on one or more Int64 operands. Therefore, the following code produces incorrect results:\n\nTo get an Int64 return value in this situation, cast as Int64:\n\nFor more information, see Arithmetic Operators.\n\nWhen you increment the last value or decrement the first value of an integer type, the result wraps around the beginning or end of the range. For example, the ShortInt type has the range -128..127; hence, after execution of the code:\n\nthe value of is -128. If compiler range-checking is enabled, however, this code generates a runtime error.\n\nThe character types are Char, AnsiChar, WideChar, UCS2Char, and UCS4Char:\n• Char in the current implementation is equivalent to WideChar, since now the default string type is UnicodeString. Because the implementation of Char can change in future releases, it is a good idea to use the standard function SizeOf rather than a hard-coded constant when writing programs that may need to handle characters of different sizes.\n• AnsiChar values are byte-sized (8-bit) characters ordered according to the locale character set, which is possibly multibyte.\n• WideChar characters use more than one byte to represent every character. In the current implementations, WideChar is word-sized (16-bit) characters ordered according to the Unicode character set (note that it could be longer in future implementations). The first 256 Unicode characters correspond to the ANSI characters.\n• UCS2Char is an alias for WideChar.\n• UCS4Char is used for working with 4–byte Unicode characters.\n\nA string constant of length 1, such as 'A', can denote a character value. The predefined function Chr returns the character value for any integer in the range of WideChar; for example, Chr(65) returns the letter A.\n\nAnsiChar and WideChar values, like integers, wrap around when decremented or incremented past the beginning or end of their range (unless range-checking is enabled). For example, after execution of the code:\n\nhas the value A (ASCII 65).\n\nThe 4 predefined Boolean types are Boolean, ByteBool, WordBool, and LongBool. Boolean is the preferred type. The others exist to provide compatibility with other languages and operating system libraries.\n\nA Boolean variable occupies one byte of memory, a ByteBool variable also occupies one byte, a WordBool variable occupies 2 bytes (one word), and a LongBool variable occupies 4 bytes (2 words).\n\nBoolean values are denoted by the predefined constants True and False. The following relationships hold:\n\n\n\n A value of type ByteBool, LongBool, or WordBool is considered True when its ordinality is nonzero. If such a value appears in a context where a Boolean is expected, the compiler automatically converts any value of nonzero ordinality to True.\n\nThe previous remarks refer to the ordinality of Boolean values, not to the values themselves. In Delphi, Boolean expressions cannot be equated with integers or reals. Hence, if X is an integer variable, the statement:\n\ngenerates a compilation error. Casting the variable to a Boolean type is unreliable, but each of the following alternatives will work.\n\nAn enumerated type defines an ordered set of values by simply listing identifiers that denote these values. The values have no inherent meaning. To declare an enumerated type, use the syntax:\n\nwhere and each are valid identifiers. For example, the declaration:\n\ndefines an enumerated type called , whose possible values are , , , and , where Ord(Club) returns 0, Ord(Diamond) returns 1, and so on.\n\nWhen you declare an enumerated type, you are declaring each to be a constant of type . If the identifiers are used for another purpose within the same scope, naming conflicts occur. For example, suppose you declare the type:\n\nUnfortunately, Click is also the name of a method defined for TControl and all of the objects in VCL that descend from it. So if you are writing an application and you create an event handler like:\n\nyou will get a compilation error; the compiler interprets Click within the scope of the procedure as a reference to a Click method of a TForm. You can work around this by qualifying the identifier; thus, if TSound is declared in MyUnit, you would use:\n\nA better solution, however, is to choose constant names that are not likely to conflict with other identifiers. Examples:\n\nYou can use the construction directly in variable declarations, as if it were a type name:\n\nBut if you declare this way, you cannot declare another variable within the same scope using these constant identifiers. Thus:\n\nBy default, the ordinalities of enumerated values start from 0 and follow the sequence in which their identifiers are listed in the type declaration. You can override this by explicitly assigning ordinalities to some or all of the values in the declaration. To assign an ordinality to a value, follow its identifier with = constantExpression, where constantExpression is a constant expression that evaluates to an integer. For example:\n\ndefines a type called whose possible values include , , and , where Ord(Small) returns 5, Ord(Medium) returns 10, and Ord(Large) returns 15.\n\nAn enumerated type is, in effect, a subrange whose lowest and highest values correspond to the lowest and highest ordinalities of the constants in the declaration. In the previous example, the type has 11 possible values whose ordinalities range from 5 to 15. (Hence the type represents an array of 11 characters.) Only three of these values have names, but the others are accessible through typecasts and through routines such as Pred, Succ, Inc, and Dec. In the following example, \"anonymous\" values in the range of are assigned to the variable .\n\nAny value that is not explicitly assigned an ordinality has the ordinality one greater than that of the previous value in the list. If the first value is not assigned an ordinality, its ordinality is 0. Hence, given the declaration:\n\nhas only two possible values: Ord(e1) returns 0, Ord(e2) returns 1, and Ord(e3) also returns 1; because and have the same ordinality, they represent the same value.\n\nEnumerated constants without a specific value have RTTI:\n\nwhereas enumerated constants with a specific value, such as the following, do not have RTTI:\n\nYou can use scoped enumerations in Delphi code if you enable the {$SCOPEDENUMS ON} compiler directive.\n\nThe {$SCOPEDENUMS ON or OFF} compiler directive enables or disables the use of scoped enumerations in Delphi code. {$SCOPEDENUMS ON} defines that enumerations are scoped. {$SCOPEDENUMS ON} affects declarations of enumeration types until the nearest {$SCOPEDENUMS OFF} directive. The identifiers of the enumeration introduced in enumeration types declared after the {$SCOPEDENUMS ON} directive are not added to the global scope. To use a scoped enumeration identifier, you should qualify it with the name of the enumeration type introducing this identifier.\n\nFor instance, let us define the following unit in the Unit1.pas file\n\nand the following program using this unit\n\nNow we can investigate effects of the {$SCOPEDENUMS} compiler directive on the scopes in which the , , and identifiers, defined in the enumeration, are visible.\n\nFirst, Run (F9) on this code. The code runs successfully. This means that the identifier, used in the\n\nvariable, is the global scope identifier introduced in the\n\nNow clear comment from the\n\ncompiler directive in the unit. This directive enforces the enumeration to be scoped. Execute Run. The E2003 Undeclared identifier 'First' error is generated on the\n\nline. It informs that the compiler directive prevents the identifier, introduced in the scoped enumeration, to be added to the global scope.\n\nTo use identifiers introduced in scoped enumerations, prefix a reference to an enumeration's element with its type name. For example, clear comment in the second\n\nversion of the variable (and comment the first version of ). Execute Run. The program runs successfully. This means that the identifier is known in the scope.\n\ncompiler directive in . Then clear comment from the declaration of the variable\n\nand again use the\n\nvariable. Now the code in the looks like this:\n\nline causes the E2010 Incompatible types - 'TMyEnum' and 'Integer' error. This means that the naming conflict occurs between the global scope identifier introduced in the enumeration and the variable. You can work around this conflict by qualifying the identifier with the unit in which it is defined. For this, comment again the first version of variable and clear comment from the third one:\n\nExecute Run. The program runs successfully. That is, now the identifier can be qualified with the unit scope. But what happens if we again enable the\n\ncompiler directive in . The compiler generates the E2003 Undeclared identifier 'First' error on the\n\nline. This means that {$SCOPEDENUMS ON} prevents adding the enumeration's identifier in the scope. Now the identifier is added only in the enumeration's scope. To check this, let us again use the\n\nversion of the variable. Execute Run and the code succeeds.\n\nA subrange type represents a subset of the values in another ordinal type (called the base type). Any construction of the form , where and are constant expressions of the same ordinal type and is less than , identifies a subrange type that includes all values between and . For example, if you declare the enumerated type:\n\nyou can then define a subrange type like:\n\nHere TMyColors includes the values , , , , and .\n\nYou can use numeric constants and characters (string constants of length 1) to define subrange types:\n\nWhen you use numeric or character constants to define a subrange, the base type is the smallest integer or character type that contains the specified range.\n\nThe construction itself functions as a type name, so you can use it directly in variable declarations. For example:\n\ndeclares an integer variable whose value can be anywhere in the range from 1 through 500.\n\nThe ordinality of each value in a subrange is preserved from the base type. (In the first example, if is a variable that holds the value , Ord(Color) returns 2 regardless of whether is of type TColors or TMyColors.) Values do not wrap around the beginning or end of a subrange, even if the base is an integer or character type; incrementing or decrementing past the boundary of a subrange simply converts the value to the base type. Hence, while:\n\nproduces an error, the following code:\n\nassigns the value 100 to (unless compiler range-checking is enabled).\n\nThe use of constant expressions in subrange definitions introduces a syntactic difficulty. In any type declaration, when the first meaningful character after = is a left parenthesis, the compiler assumes that an enumerated type is being defined. Hence the code:\n\nproduces an error. Work around this problem by rewriting the type declaration to avoid the leading parenthesis:\n\nA real type defines a set of numbers that can be represented with the floating-point notation. The table below gives the ranges and storage formats for the real types on 64-bit and 32-bit platforms.\n\n\n\n The following remarks apply to real types:\n• Real is equivalent to Double, in the current implementation.\n• Real48 is maintained for backward compatibility. Since its storage format is not native to the Intel processor architecture, it results in slower performance than other floating-point types.\n• Extended offers greater precision on 32-bit platforms than other real types.\n• The Comp (computational) type is native to the Intel processor architecture and represents a 64-bit integer. It is classified as a real, however, because it does not behave like an ordinal type. (For example, you cannot increment or decrement a Comp value.) Comp is maintained for backward compatibility only. Use the Int64 type for better performance.\n• Currency is a fixed-point data type that minimizes rounding errors in monetary calculations. It is stored as a scaled 64-bit integer with the 4 least significant digits implicitly representing decimal places. When mixed with other real types in assignments and expressions, Currency values are automatically divided or multiplied by 10000."

        "document": "Binary trees are essential structures in computer science, acting as the backbone for many algorithms and applications. This guide aims to demystify binary trees for beginners, breaking down their types, traversal methods, and practical implementations in Python. By understanding these concepts, you’ll be well-equipped to tackle more complex data structures and algorithms.\n• Binary trees consist of nodes, where each node can have up to two children.\n• Different types of binary trees include full, complete, and balanced trees, each serving unique purposes.\n• Traversal methods like pre-order, in-order, and post-order allow us to visit nodes in specific sequences.\n• Implementing binary trees in Python involves creating classes for nodes and trees and learning how to insert and delete nodes.\n• Binary trees have various applications, such as in search algorithms, expression trees, and heaps used in priority queues.\n\nA binary tree is a special kind of data structure that organizes information in a hierarchical way. In this structure, each node can have at most two children, known as the left child and the right child. This makes it easy to manage and access data efficiently.\n\nBinary trees are crucial in computer science for several reasons:\n• They help in organizing data in a way that makes searching faster.\n• They are used in various algorithms, such as sorting and searching.\n• They form the basis for more complex data structures like binary search trees and heaps.\n• Node: The basic unit of a binary tree, which contains data and links to its children.\n• Leaf: A node that does not have any children.\n• Height: The length of the longest path from the root to a leaf.\n\nIn summary, binary trees are a fundamental data structure that plays a vital role in various computer science applications. By grasping the basic terminology and concepts, beginners can build a strong foundation for further learning in data structures and algorithms.\n\nBinary trees come in various forms, each with unique characteristics and uses. Understanding these types is essential for mastering binary trees.\n\nA full binary tree is a type of binary tree where every node has either 0 or 2 children. This means that no node has only one child. Here are some key points about full binary trees:\n• All leaf nodes are at the same level.\n• The number of nodes at each level doubles as you go down the tree.\n• They are often used in applications where a complete structure is needed.\n\nA complete binary tree is similar to a full binary tree, but it allows for the last level to be filled from left to right. Here are some features:\n• All levels, except possibly the last, are fully filled.\n• The last level has all nodes as far left as possible.\n• This structure is useful in implementing heaps.\n\nA balanced binary tree maintains a height difference of no more than one between the left and right subtrees of any node. This balance ensures efficient operations. Key points include:\n• They provide better performance for search operations.\n• Balancing helps in keeping the tree height minimal, which is crucial for performance.\n\nIn summary, knowing the types of binary trees helps in choosing the right one for your application, ensuring efficiency and effectiveness in data handling. Binary trees are fundamental in data structure design, making them a key topic for beginners to grasp.\n\nTree traversal refers to the process of visiting or accessing each node of the tree exactly once in a certain order. Understanding these traversal methods is essential for working with binary trees effectively. Here, we will explore three main traversal techniques: pre-order, in-order, and post-order.\n\nIn pre-order traversal, the order of visiting nodes is: root, left subtree, and then right subtree. This method is useful when you want to process the root before its children. For example, it can be used to create a copy of the tree.\n\nIn-order traversal visits nodes in the following order: left subtree, root, and then right subtree. This method is particularly important in binary search trees (BSTs) because it retrieves elements in sorted order.\n\nPost-order traversal visits nodes in this order: left subtree, right subtree, and then root. This method is useful for operations that require processing children before their parent, such as deleting a tree.\n\nTo start working with binary trees in Python, you need to set up your environment. Here’s how:\n• Install Python: Make sure you have Python installed on your computer. You can download it from the official website.\n• Choose an IDE: Use an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like PyCharm, VSCode, or even Jupyter Notebook for coding.\n• Create a New Project: Start a new project where you will write your binary tree code.\n\nIn Python, we can represent a binary tree using classes. Here’s a simple way to create a node and a tree:\n\nTo manage nodes in a binary tree, we need methods for inserting and deleting nodes. Here’s a basic example:\n• If the tree is empty, the new node becomes the root.\n• If the tree is not empty, compare the value of the new node with the current node and decide to go left or right.\n• If it has no children, simply remove it.\n• If it has one child, replace it with its child.\n• If it has two children, find the in-order successor to replace it.\n\nImplementing binary trees in Python involves setting up your environment, creating classes for nodes and trees, and writing methods for inserting and deleting nodes. Mastering these basics will set a strong foundation for more advanced tree operations.\n\nSearching for a node in a binary tree is a fundamental operation. Here’s how you can do it:\n• Compare the target value with the current node’s value.\n• If they match, you’ve found the node!\n• If the target value is smaller, search the left subtree.\n• If it’s larger, search the right subtree.\n• Repeat until you find the node or reach a leaf node.\n\nThe height of a binary tree is the length of the longest path from the root to a leaf. To find it:\n• If the tree is empty, the height is -1.\n• If it has only one node, the height is 0.\n• For other cases, use the formula:\n• Height = 1 + max(height of left subtree, height of right subtree)\n\nCounting nodes in a binary tree can be done using a simple recursive method:\n• If the tree is empty, return 0.\n• Otherwise, return 1 (for the current node) + count of left subtree + count of right subtree.\n\nBinary trees are not just theoretical concepts; they have real-world applications that make them essential in various fields of computer science. Here are some key areas where binary trees are utilized:\n• Sorted Data Storage: A binary search tree (BST) is a data structure used to store data in a sorted manner. Each node in a BST has at most two children, which allows for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations.\n• Fast Lookups: Searching for a value in a BST can be done in O(log n) time on average, making it much faster than linear search methods.\n• Dynamic Data Handling: BSTs can easily adapt to changes in data, allowing for efficient updates.\n• Mathematical Expressions: Expression trees represent expressions in a tree format, where each leaf node is an operand and each internal node is an operator. This structure is useful for evaluating expressions and converting between different notations (like infix to postfix).\n• Compiler Design: Compilers use expression trees to parse and evaluate expressions during code compilation.\n• Simplifying Calculations: They help in simplifying complex expressions by breaking them down into manageable parts.\n• Task Scheduling: Heaps are a special type of binary tree used to implement priority queues, which are essential in task scheduling systems.\n• Efficient Sorting: Heaps can be used to sort data efficiently using heap sort, which has a time complexity of O(n log n).\n• Resource Management: In operating systems, heaps help manage resources by prioritizing tasks based on their importance.\n\nIn summary, binary trees play a crucial role in many applications, from data storage and retrieval to expression evaluation and resource management. Understanding these applications helps in grasping the importance of binary trees in the broader context of data structures and algorithms.\n\nBalancing a binary tree is crucial for maintaining its efficiency. A balanced binary tree ensures that operations like insertion, deletion, and searching can be performed quickly. The main technique used to balance trees is through rotations. Here are the types of rotations:\n• Left Rotation: This is used when a right-heavy tree needs balancing.\n• Right Rotation: This is applied to left-heavy trees.\n• Left-Right Rotation: A combination of left and right rotations for specific cases.\n\nAVL trees are a type of self-balancing binary search tree. They maintain a height difference of at most 1 between the left and right subtrees. This means that a binary tree is balanced if the height of the tree is O(log n) where n is the number of nodes. For example, the AVL tree maintains O(log n) height. Here’s how to implement an AVL tree:\n• Insert a Node: Add the node like in a regular binary search tree.\n• Check Balance: After insertion, check the balance factor of each node.\n• Perform Rotations: If the tree is unbalanced, perform the necessary rotations to restore balance.\n\nRed-black trees are another type of self-balancing binary tree. They ensure that the tree remains approximately balanced during insertions and deletions. The properties of red-black trees include:\n• Each node is either red or black.\n• The root is always black.\n• Every path from a node to its descendant leaves must have the same number of black nodes.\n\nBy understanding these concepts, you can effectively manage and implement balanced binary trees in your projects.\n\nThreaded binary trees are a special type of binary tree where the null pointers are replaced with pointers to the next node in the in-order traversal. This allows for faster traversal without using a stack or recursion. This structure is particularly useful for in-order traversal as it makes it easier to navigate through the tree.\n\nBinary space partitioning (BSP) is a method for recursively subdividing a space into convex sets by hyperplanes. This technique is widely used in computer graphics for rendering scenes. It helps in efficiently organizing objects in a scene, allowing for quick visibility determination. Here’s a simple breakdown of its advantages:\n• Efficient Rendering: Reduces the number of objects to be rendered.\n\nSegment trees are a powerful data structure used for storing intervals or segments. They allow querying which segments overlap with a given point efficiently. This is particularly useful in scenarios like:\n• Range Queries: Quickly find the sum or minimum in a range of values.\n• Interval Overlap: Determine if a point lies within any segment.\n\nIn summary, mastering advanced binary tree concepts like threaded binary trees, binary space partitioning, and segment trees can greatly improve your programming skills. These structures not only optimize performance but also open up new possibilities for solving complex problems in computer science.\n\nThe concept of phylo2vec is an example of how binary trees can be utilized in biological data analysis, showcasing their versatility in different domains.\n\nWhen working with binary trees, you might encounter several common issues. Here are some typical errors and how to fix them:\n• Null Pointer Exceptions: Ensure that you check for null nodes before accessing their properties.\n• Infinite Loops: Make sure your traversal methods have proper base cases to prevent endless recursion.\n• Incorrect Node Connections: Double-check that you are linking child nodes correctly when inserting or deleting nodes.\n\nDebugging binary trees can be tricky, but here are some effective strategies:\n• Print Statements: Use print statements to display the current node and its children during traversal.\n• Visual Representation: Draw the tree structure on paper or use a tool to visualize the tree at different stages.\n• Unit Tests: Write tests for each function to ensure they work as expected, especially for insertion and deletion.\n\nTo enhance the performance of your binary tree operations, consider the following tips:\n• Use Iterative Methods: For large trees, iterative methods can help avoid stack overflow issues.\n• Balance the Tree: Implement balancing techniques to keep the tree height minimal, improving search times.\n• Profile Your Code: Use profiling tools to identify bottlenecks in your tree operations.\n\nUnderstanding common errors, employing debugging techniques, and optimizing performance are crucial for mastering binary trees. With practice, you will become more adept at troubleshooting and ensuring your binary tree implementations run smoothly.\n• Model debugging strategies can be applied to improve your understanding of binary trees. Learning techniques for visualizing data can significantly enhance your debugging process.\n\nCreating a simple database index using binary trees can help you understand how data is organized and retrieved efficiently. Here’s how you can approach this project:\n• Define the structure of your binary tree nodes to hold data and pointers to left and right children.\n• Implement insertion methods to add new records while maintaining the binary search tree properties.\n• Create search functions to retrieve records based on keys, showcasing the efficiency of binary trees.\n\nHuffman coding is a popular method for data compression. You can implement this using binary trees:\n• Build a frequency table of characters from the input data.\n• Create a priority queue to build the Huffman tree based on character frequencies.\n• Generate codes for each character by traversing the tree, where left edges represent 0 and right edges represent 1.\n\nDecision trees are widely used in machine learning for classification tasks. Here’s a simple way to create one:\n• Select a dataset that you want to classify.\n• Choose a splitting criterion (like Gini impurity or information gain) to decide how to split the data at each node.\n• Recursively build the tree by splitting the dataset until you reach a stopping condition (like a maximum depth or minimum samples per leaf).\n\nBy working on these projects, you will gain practical experience with binary trees and understand their applications in real-world scenarios.\n\nHere are some great books and articles to help you dive deeper into binary trees and data structures:\n• \"Data Structures and Algorithms in Python\" by Michael T. Goodrich et al.\n• \"Introduction to Algorithms\" by Thomas H. Cormen et al.\n• \"Data Structures and Algorithms in Java\" by Robert Lafore\n\nConsider these online resources for structured learning:\n\nTo sharpen your skills, try these exercises:\n• Implement a binary search tree and perform basic operations like insertion and deletion.\n• Write a program to find the height of a binary tree.\n• Create a function to count the number of nodes in a tree.\n\nIf you’re eager to dive deeper into coding and enhance your skills, check out our website!

Don’t wait—start your journey today!\n\nIn summary, getting to know and using binary trees is a key part of learning computer science. These trees are important for many tasks, like evaluating expressions and managing data. Each way to go through a binary tree—whether it’s in-order for sorting, pre-order for copying, or post-order for safely removing nodes—has its own special use. Both the recursive and iterative methods have their benefits: recursion makes the code easier to read, while iterative methods can help avoid problems with memory limits. This guide aims to give you a solid grasp of binary tree traversal techniques and shows how to choose the right method based on what you need.

Tree Traversal algorithms can be classified broadly into two categories, DFS and BFS:\n\nDepth-First Search (DFS) algorithms: DFS explores as far down a branch as possible before backtracking. It is implemented using recursion. The main traversal methods in DFS for binary trees are:\n\nBreadth-First Search (BFS) algorithms: BFS explores all nodes at the present depth before moving on to nodes at the next depth level. It is typically implemented using a queue. BFS in a binary tree is commonly referred to as Level Order Traversal.\n\nBelow is the implementation of traversals algorithm in binary tree:\n\nInserting elements means add a new node into the binary tree. As we know that there is no such ordering of elements in the binary tree, So we do not have to worry about the ordering of node in the binary tree. We would first creates a root node in case of empty tree. Then subsequent insertions involve iteratively searching for an empty place at each level of the tree. When an empty left or right child is found then new node is inserted there. By convention, insertion always starts with the left child node.\n\n// Function to insert a new node in the binary tree // If the tree is empty, create the root node // Do level order traversal until we find an empty place // If left child is empty, insert the new node here // If right child is empty, insert the new node here // Function to insert a new node in the binary tree // If left child is empty, insert the new node here // If right child is empty, insert the new node here // Function to insert a new node in the binary tree // If left child is empty, insert the new node here // If right child is empty, insert the new node here # Function to insert a new node in the binary tree # If left child is empty, insert the new node here # If right child is empty, insert the new node here // Function to insert a new node in the binary tree // If left child is empty, insert the new node here // If right child is empty, insert the new node here // Function to insert a new node in the binary tree // If left child is empty, insert the new node here // If right child is empty, insert the new node here\n\nSearching for a value in a binary tree means looking through the tree to find a node that has that value. Since binary trees do not have a specific order like binary search trees, we typically use any traversal method to search. The most common methods are depth-first search (DFS) and breadth-first search (BFS). In DFS, we start from the root and explore the depth nodes first. In BFS, we explore all the nodes at the present depth level before moving on to the nodes at the next level. We continue this process until we either find the node with the desired value or reach the end of the tree. If the tree is empty or the value isn’t found after exploring all possibilities, we conclude that the value does not exist in the tree.\n\nHere is the implementation of searching in a binary tree using Depth-First Search (DFS)\n\n// Function to search for a value in the binary tree using DFS // Base case: If the tree is empty or we've reached a leaf node // If the node's data is equal to the value we are searching for // Recursively search in the left and right subtrees \" is found in the binary tree\" \" is not found in the binary tree\" // Function to search for a value in the binary tree using DFS // Base case: If the tree is empty or we've reached a leaf node // If the node's data is equal to the value we are searching for // Recursively search in the left and right subtrees \"%d is found in the binary tree \"%d is not found in the binary tree // Function to search for a value in the binary tree // Base case: If the tree is empty or we've reached // If the node's data is equal to the value we are // Recursively search in the left and right subtrees \" is found in the binary tree\" \" is not found in the binary tree\" # Function to search for a value in the binary tree using DFS # Base case: If the tree is empty or we've reached a leaf node # If the node's data is equal to the value we are searching for # Recursively search in the left and right subtrees is found in the binary tree\" is not found in the binary tree\" // Function to search for a value in the binary tree // Base case: If the tree is empty or we've reached // If the node's data is equal to the value we are // Recursively search in the left and right subtrees \"{0} is found in the binary tree\" \"{0} is not found in the binary tree\" // Function to search for a value in the binary tree using DFS // Base case: If the tree is empty or we've reached a leaf node // If the node's data is equal to the value we are searching for // Recursively search in the left and right subtrees is found in the binary tree` is not found in the binary tree`\n\nDeleting a node from a binary tree means removing a specific node while keeping the tree’s structure. First, we need to find the node that want to delete by traversing through the tree using any traversal method. Then replace the node’s value with the value of the last node in the tree (found by traversing to the rightmost leaf), and then delete that last node. This way, the tree structure won’t be effected. And remember to check for special cases, like trying to delete from an empty tree, to avoid any issues.\n\nNote: There is no specific rule of deletion but we always make sure that during deletion the binary tree proper should be preserved.\n\n// Function to delete a node from the binary tree // Check for current node is the target node to delete // If target node is not found, return the original tree // Find the deepest rightmost node and its parent // Replace target's value with the last node's value // If the last node was the root // Function to delete a node from the binary tree // Find the deepest rightmost node and its parent // Replace target's value with the last node's value // Function to delete a node from the binary tree // Find the deepest rightmost node and its parent // Replace target's value with the last node's value # Function to delete a node from the binary tree # Find the deepest rightmost node and its parent # Replace target's value with the last node's value // Function to delete a node from the binary tree // Find the deepest rightmost node and its parent // Replace target's value with the last node's value // Function to delete a node from the binary tree // Find the deepest rightmost node and its parent // Replace target's value with the last node's value\n• None Finding the height of the tree\n• None Finding the size of the entire tree\n\nNote: We can use Morris Traversal to traverse all the nodes of the binary tree in O(n) time complexity but with O(1) auxiliary space.\n• Efficient Search: (a variation of Binary Tree) are efficient when searching for a specific element, as each node has at most two child nodes when compared to linked list and arrays\n• Memory Efficient: Binary trees require lesser memory as compared to other tree data structures, therefore memory-efficient.\n• None Binary trees are relatively easy to implement and understand as each node has at most two children, left child and right child.\n• Limited structure: Binary trees are limited to two child nodes per node, which can limit their usefulness in certain applications. For example, if a tree requires more than two child nodes per node, a different tree structure may be more suitable.\n• Unbalanced trees: Unbalanced binary trees, where one subtree is significantly larger than the other, can lead to inefficient search operations. This can occur if the tree is not properly balanced or if data is inserted in a non-random order.\n• Space inefficiency: Binary trees can be space inefficient when compared to other data structures like arrays and linked list. This is because each node requires two child references or pointers, which can be a significant amount of memory overhead for large trees.\n• Slow performance in worst-case scenarios: In the worst-case scenario, a binary tree can become degenerate or skewed, meaning that each node has only one child. In this case, search operations in (a variation of Binary Tree) can degrade to O(n) time complexity, where n is the number of nodes in the tree.\n• None Binary Tree can be used to represent hierarchical data\n• None Huffman Coding trees are used in data compression algorithms\n• None is another application of binary tree that is used for searching maximum or minimum in O(1) time complexity.\n• None Useful for indexing segmented at the database is useful in storing cache in the system,\n• None Binary trees can be used to implement decision trees, a type of machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression analysis.\n\n2.
