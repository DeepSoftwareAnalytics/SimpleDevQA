        "document": "Resizable-array implementation of theinterface. Implements all optional list operations, and permits all elements, including. In addition to implementing theinterface, this class provides methods to manipulate the size of the array that is used internally to store the list. (This class is roughly equivalent to, except that it is unsynchronized.)\n\nThe , , , , , and operations run in constant time. The operation runs in amortized constant time, that is, adding n elements requires O(n) time. All of the other operations run in linear time (roughly speaking). The constant factor is low compared to that for the implementation.\n\nEach instance has a capacity. The capacity is the size of the array used to store the elements in the list. It is always at least as large as the list size. As elements are added to an ArrayList, its capacity grows automatically. The details of the growth policy are not specified beyond the fact that adding an element has constant amortized time cost.\n\nAn application can increase the capacity of an instance before adding a large number of elements using the operation. This may reduce the amount of incremental reallocation.\n\nNote that this implementation is not synchronized. If multiple threads access an instance concurrently, and at least one of the threads modifies the list structurally, it must be synchronized externally. (A structural modification is any operation that adds or deletes one or more elements, or explicitly resizes the backing array; merely setting the value of an element is not a structural modification.) This is typically accomplished by synchronizing on some object that naturally encapsulates the list. If no such object exists, the list should be \"wrapped\" using the method. This is best done at creation time, to prevent accidental unsynchronized access to the list:\n\nThe iterators returned by this class's and methods are fail-fast: if the list is structurally modified at any time after the iterator is created, in any way except through the iterator's own or methods, the iterator will throw a . Thus, in the face of concurrent modification, the iterator fails quickly and cleanly, rather than risking arbitrary, non-deterministic behavior at an undetermined time in the future.\n\nNote that the fail-fast behavior of an iterator cannot be guaranteed as it is, generally speaking, impossible to make any hard guarantees in the presence of unsynchronized concurrent modification. Fail-fast iterators throw on a best-effort basis. Therefore, it would be wrong to write a program that depended on this exception for its correctness: the fail-fast behavior of iterators should be used only to detect bugs.\n\nThis class is a member of the Java Collections Framework."

        "document": "“Depth-first search is a traversal technique where we traverse the graph in depth exploring its neighbors”. You know sometimes textbooks are dumb, quite natural.\n\nBefore understanding the depth-first search let me tell you a story :)\n\nRemember Famous Gta Vice City Tommy’s estate “Maze”, look at the picture below\n\nWhat we do here \n\n1) Tommy(Vice City character) enters the maze at a “particular entry point”\n\n2) Continue traveling a path in the maze until he finds the dead end where you can't go further.\n\n3) Once Tommy finds the dead end he turns back and starts running back where he came from and once he reaches the starting point he starts traveling to another “unexplored path”.\n\n4) Tommy follows the above 3 steps until he finds every possible path out.\n\nnow let's link this story with our famous “Depth-first search” 👇,\n\n1) Just like Tommy We start from a random starting vertex( usually 0) in the graph\n\n2) Next just like Tommy we travel the path we started until we reach a dead end, which means from the starting vertex we look at the unvisited neighbors of the starting vertex, “well where do we get this neighbor from?” we get this from the adjacency list ( where we store neighbors of the node in a list, refer to the previous article if you forgot the adjacency list).\n\n3) we reach the dead end means, while traveling at one point we reach the node that has no unvisited neighbors, there we backtrack or simply turn around and come back to the starting vertex where we started from.\n\n4) once we come back to the starting vertex we explore the next unvisited neighbor.\n\nDfs follow these steps until every vertex is visited. Below are the visual representation for the process.\n• Start at a chosen vertex (the starting vertex) of the graph.\n• Visit the starting vertex and mark it as visited in the boolean array.\n• Explore one of the unvisited neighbors of the current vertex.\n• Repeat step 3 recursively for the unvisited neighbors until all reachable vertices from the starting vertex have been visited.\n• Backtrack to the previous vertex when we find any node when all its neighbors are visited and explore any remaining unvisited neighbors.\n• Repeat steps 3–5 until all vertices in the graph have been visited.\n\nbelow is the process visualization:\n\nBreadth-first search is another traversal technique that we use to travel the graph. In bfs we systematically explore and visit all the nodes of a graph or tree in a“ level-by-level manner”. It starts from a designated starting node (often referred to as the “source” or “root” node) and explores all its neighbors first before moving on to the next level of neighbors.\n\nlet's understand it with a real-life example\n\nconsider we are searching for a book in a library, a book rack that contains multiple rows, the usual way to search is to search the racks in a level-wise manner. This means we start by searching for the book in the first row once we complete searching we move to the next. we don't move to the second row until we are done searching the first row this is how exactly the breadth-first search works.\n\nnow let’s link this scenario with our famous “Breadth-first search” 👇,\n\nThe way we are searching for the book in a rack is in the “level-wise” fashion which means “we don’t move to the next until we are done with the current .”\n\nIn bfs we start from a source node usually “0” and explore or visit all its neighbors first before moving on to the next, unlike dfs , bfs first visits all its neighbors of the current node and proceeds to the next node in the graph means as we start from zero we complete visiting all neighbors of zero first and move to one next i.e 1.\n\nData structures we use to perform bfs:\n• Visited Array i.e “boolean vis[] = new boolean[no.of vertices] or int[] vis = new int[no.of vertices];”\n\nQueue is often referred as a “First In First Out (FIFO)” data structure which means “what comes first goes out first”. To simply understand the working principle it is ideally equal to “Standing in the queue at a movie ticket issuing counter, one who comes first gets his ticket first and exits the queue first”.\n\nThe reason why we use a queue is that, we need to process the nodes level by level, so apparently bfs want us to process the nodes that come first like bfs wants us to process the nodes and their children in level 1 first then go to level 2 so on level n. so making this “first come first serve” as priority the suitable data structure that we can come up with is a queue.\n\nStep 1 : Add the starting node on to the queue\n\nStep 2 : Remove or pop the node fromfront of the queue and mark it as visited and add all its unvisited neighbors on to the queue using the adjacency list.\n\nSteps 3 : Continue step 2 until the queue is empty\n\nStep 4 : bfs terminates when queue is empty indicating all vertices are visited."

If you're a developer and the term \"graph\" only conjures up images of pie charts and bar graphs, get ready to expand your horizons. Graphs, in the data structure sense, are the unsung heroes behind a lot of complex computer science problems and real-world applications. From social networks and recommendation engines to finding the shortest path from point A to point B, graphs do it all. This guide will cover everything, from fundamentals to advanced graph algorithms. Buckle up; it's going to be a wild ride filled with knowledge, humor, and code snippets that’ll make you a graph guru in Java!\n\n1. What Is a Graph, Anyway?\n\nAt its core, a graph is a collection of nodes (vertices) connected by edges. Unlike your average data structure, which might be linear (like arrays or linked lists), graphs allow for more complex relationships.\n\nA graph GGG is defined as G=(V,E)G = (V, E)G=(V,E) where:\n• EEE is a set of edges connecting pairs of vertices.\n\nGraphs can be directed or undirected. In a directed graph, if Alice points to Bob, think of Alice saying, \"Hey Bob, I follow you, but you don’t follow me back.\"\n• Undirected Graph: The relationship between nodes is two-way. If there's an edge between A and B, you can travel from A to B and B to A.\n• Directed Graph (Digraph): Edges have a direction. If there's an edge from A to B, you can go from A to B but not necessarily back.\n• Weighted Graph: Each edge has an associated weight (think of it as a distance or cost).\n• Unweighted Graph: All edges are treated equally with no weight.\n• Cyclic Graph: Contains at least one cycle (a path that starts and ends at the same node).\n• Acyclic Graph: No cycles exist. The most famous type? The DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph), which is the backbone of topological sorting.\n• Connected Graph: All nodes are reachable from any other node.\n• Disconnected Graph: Some nodes cannot be reached from others.\n• Tree: A connected acyclic undirected graph. Think of it as a family tree without loops—no one is married to their cousin here.\n• Bipartite Graph: Can be divided into two sets such that no two graph vertices within the same set are adjacent.\n• Complete Graph: Every pair of distinct vertices is connected by an edge.\n• Sparse vs. Dense Graphs: Sparse graphs have few edges relative to the number of nodes; dense graphs are the opposite.\n\nA 2D array adj[i][j]adj[i][j]adj[i][j] is used where:\n• adj[i][j]=1adj[i][j] = 1adj[i][j]=1 if there is an edge between node i and j.\n• None adj[i][j]=weightadj[i][j] = weightadj[i][j]=weight if the graph is weighted.\n• Fast lookups: O(1) to check if an edge exists.\n\nAn array or list where each index iii holds a list of nodes connected to vertex iii. Perfect for sparse graphs.\n\nA simple list of all edges. Each edge is represented as a pair (or triplet for weighted graphs).\n• Social Networks: Users are nodes, and friendships are edges.\n• Web Crawling: Pages are nodes, and hyperlinks are edges.\n• Routing Algorithms: Google Maps, anyone? Cities as nodes and roads as edges.\n• Recommendation Systems: Products are nodes; “customers who bought X also bought Y” forms edges.\n• \n• Great for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.\n• \n• Goes as deep as possible before backtracking.\n• Useful for pathfinding and cycle detection.\n• Bellman-Ford Algorithm: Can handle negative weights but slower than Dijkstra.\n• Floyd-Warshall Algorithm: Finds shortest paths between all pairs of nodes; useful for dense graphs.\n• Prim’s Algorithm: Builds MST by adding the cheapest edge from the growing tree.\n• Used for directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). Perfect for dependency resolution like job scheduling.\n• DFS-based Approach: Keep track of nodes in the current DFS stack.\n\nGreat for problems like \"shortest distance to a particular type of node\" where there are multiple starting points.\n\nPowerful for handling connected components and cycle detection in undirected graphs.\n\nDynamic programming can be combined with graph traversal to optimize solutions to repetitive sub-problems.\n\nUsed in pathfinding with an informed guess (heuristic). Works like Dijkstra but prioritizes paths closer to the destination.\n• Pathfinding: \"Find the shortest route from X to Y.\"\n• Dependency Chains: \"Tasks that depend on other tasks.\"\n• Traversal Scenarios: \"Visit all rooms,\" or \"Explore all options.\"\n\nIf you’ve made it this far, congratulations! You’ve not only survived the wild ride through graphs but also equipped yourself with the knowledge to tackle any graph-related question thrown your way. Whether you’re a coding contest junkie, an algorithm enthusiast, or just someone trying to pass your data structures course, this guide has covered everything you need.\n\nAnd remember, in the world of graphs, if you ever get lost, just traverse back to this guide!"

A back edge is an edge that is from a node to itself (selfloop) or one of its ancestor in the tree produced by DFS forming a cycle.\n\nBoth approaches above actually mean the same. However, this method can be applied only to undirected graphs.\n\nThe reason why this algorithm doesn't work for directed graphs is that in a directed graph 2 different paths to the same vertex don't make a cycle. For example: A-->B, B-->C, A-->C - don't make a cycle whereas in undirected ones: A--B, B--C, C--A does.\n\nAn undirected graph has a cycle if and only if a depth-first search (DFS) finds an edge that points to an already-visited vertex (a back edge).\n\nIn addition to visited vertices we need to keep track of vertices currently in recursion stack of function for DFS traversal. If we reach a vertex that is already in the recursion stack, then there is a cycle in the tree.\n\nUpdate: Working code is in the question section above."
