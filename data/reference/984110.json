        "document": "In the fast-paced world of software development, writing clean and efficient code is of utmost importance. Complex and convoluted code can be difficult to maintain, debug, and enhance, leading to decreased productivity and increased frustration. This is where code refactoring comes into play. By restructuring existing code without changing its external behavior, refactoring improves code readability, maintainability, and performance. In this comprehensive guide, we will explore the top C# code refactoring tools that can help simplify and optimize your codebase.\n\n1.Visual Studio Refactoring Tools: Visual Studio, the popular integrated development environment (IDE) for C#, offers a wide range of built-in refactoring tools. Let’s take a look at some commonly used ones:\n\na) Extract Method: This refactoring tool allows you to extract a block of code into a separate method. It promotes code reusability and enhances readability by encapsulating a logical portion of code into a meaningful method.\n\nb) Rename: The Rename tool enables you to quickly and accurately rename variables, methods, classes, and other code elements throughout your project. It ensures consistency and makes your code more maintainable.\n\nc) Extract Interface: This tool allows you to extract an interface from an existing class, promoting loose coupling and making your code more testable and flexible.\n\n2. ReSharper: ReSharper, a popular third-party extension for Visual Studio, offers a plethora of advanced code refactoring tools. Let’s explore some of its key features:\n\na) Code Cleanup: ReSharper’s Code Cleanup feature allows you to define and apply code style and quality rules throughout your project. It ensures consistent code formatting, eliminates redundancies, and enforces best practices.\n\nb) Extract Variable: This refactoring tool helps you extract repeated code fragments into a variable, improving code readability and maintainability.\n\nc) Inline Variable: The Inline Variable feature allows you to eliminate unnecessary variable assignments by replacing them with their actual values. This improves code clarity and eliminates redundant code.\n\n3. Roslyn Refactorings: Roslyn, the open-source .NET compiler platform, provides a rich set of refactoring APIs that can be leveraged by various code analysis and refactoring tools. Let’s explore some useful Roslyn refactorings:\n\na) Simplify Names: This refactoring simplifies type and namespace names by removing unnecessary qualifiers, making your code more concise and readable.\n\nb) Use Implicit Type: The Use Implicit Type refactoring replaces explicit type declarations with the var keyword when the type can be inferred from the assignment. It reduces redundancy and improves code brevity.\n\n4. Refactoring Essentials: Refactoring Essentials is a free and open-source extension for Visual Studio that provides additional code refactorings and analyzers. Some noteworthy features include:\n\na) Convert ‘foreach’ to ‘LINQ’: This refactoring transforms a foreach loop into a LINQ query, enhancing code readability and promoting functional programming.\n\nb) Introduce Field from Parameter: This refactoring creates a private field from a method parameter, reducing parameter passing and improving code encapsulation.\n\nRefactoring code is essential for simplifying and optimizing your C# software. The tools discussed in this article, such as Visual Studio Refactoring Tools, ReSharper, Roslyn Refactorings, and Refactoring Essentials, offer significant capabilities that increase code readability, maintainability, and performance. You may improve your productivity, minimize defects, and create cleaner, more efficient code by utilizing these tools. Accept the power of refactoring and improve your C# development abilities."

        "document": "Though many easy-to-use resources are available to help with refactoring, you may not know about them. Check out these 10 tips to help you with efficient refactoring.\n\nSomething we can say with certainty is that where there is code creation, there will also be refactoring. After all, code written today is tomorrow’s legacy—especially when it comes to Microsoft technologies like .NET that receive several updates every year.\n\nAs developers, we must always be aware of the latest improvements made in the technology that we work in to make the most of them. Creating something that won't be outdated in a few years or even months is impossible. Therefore, one more codebase becomes legacy and eligible for refactoring.\n\nFor us to be efficient in refactoring, several resources can help—some just restructuring the code, others through the Visual Studio IDE. Keep reading to learn 10 tips for helping you with efficient refactoring.\n\nRefactoring is a technique that basically consists of performing small transformations to the code in a way that does not change its behavior. Although small, these transformations make code easier to maintain and are intended to improve an application’s performance.\n\nRefactoring is extremely important in a development team because it’s how programmers can demonstrate the real value of their performance in existing code. Plus, there are many short- and long-term benefits of refactoring code, such as:\n• Agility: Well-written code makes it possible for developers to identify and resolve a problem in the code faster.\n• User experience: With fewer crashes and better performance, the software becomes easier to use and brings a better experience to the end user.\n• Modernization: Refactored code brings the possibility of modernizing libraries and putting the company that owns the code ahead of its competitors because it uses cutting-edge technologies already consolidated in the market.\n\nThe C# programming language has always been in constant evolution and, lately, Microsoft’s effort to transform C# into a language with less ceremony and better performance is notable.\n\nRegarding new systems, we’re free to use all the cutting-edge features made available by the latest versions of C#, but what about legacy code? That code was written when many of these features did not yet exist or were not used for some reason. In such cases, refactoring is necessary.\n\nThe following is a list of tips for refactoring code in C#. First, I’ll share poorly written code, then how it would be possible to create a better refactored version. Some examples also highlight tips on how to use Visual Studio features to perform refactoring faster.\n\nYou can access the source code with all the examples at this link.\n\n1. Instead of Foreach, Use LINQ\n\nis one of the most common methods programmers use to filter a list of values. However, although its execution is efficient, its syntax usually pollutes the code, because to find a certain value within the list it is necessary to resort to some condition operators such as and for example. To make the code more readable, a great approach is to use the resources available in LINQ, as can be seen in the example below.\n\n💡 If you are using Visual Studio, you can use a resource available that does the refactoring work for you. Just place your cursor over the code and click on the lightbulb icon, and the option “Convert to LINQ” will appear. This makes it possible to preview the refactoring result, as seen in the image below:\n\nA very common problem encountered in refactorings is methods that have more than one responsibility—that is, they are used to perform several actions, which makes the code confusing and difficult to understand. When we create methods that have a single responsibility, we can organize the code and make it cleaner and easier to understand.\n\nIn the example below, we have a method responsible for doing several things in the first version.\n\nFirst, a search is made to return all sellers. Then it checks if the mandatory fields of the new seller are filled in. If any of them is empty, an error message is returned. If not, it checks if this seller already exists in the list; if it already exists, an error message is returned, but if not, the new seller is added to the database.\n\nHere is the opportunity to create separate methods, each with its own responsibility.\n\nFor this, we will create three new methods. We will also change the name of the main method to make it more suitable for its main function.\n\nNote that in this new version, the responsibilities for each method were separated. We have a method to check if the seller already exists in the database and another method to validate the fields filled in. And, finally, we have a method to save the record if it has passed the previous validations. Thus, the code became much easier to understand and more cohesive through better-elaborated validations.\n\nAsynchronous programming has a big advantage in that running long tasks in the background is possible while faster ones are being completed. One scenario that can often take a considerable amount of time is transactions in databases, so it is always advisable to use asynchronous functions.\n\nIn the example below, we first have an example of synchronously updating records in the database. If there are few records in the database, this execution will probably be fast. But if there are many records, it may take time, and in this case the other operations will have to wait for to be started. That’s not very performant.\n\nBelow we can see the same method but done asynchronously. Note that we are using the ORM Entity Framework Core in this example, which has native asynchronous methods. In this way, persistence in the database becomes more performant because it does not lock other actions in the code.\n\nUsing constructors is considered a good practice. Through them, we manage to define default values, modify access and make more explicit the necessary values to instantiate a class—in addition to maintaining cleaner code when a class is called.\n\nNotice in the example below how classes are instantiated with no constructors. The class with the constructor is simpler because we do not need to declare the fields, just pass the values by parameter.\n\n💡 If you are using Visual Studio, generating the builder through a Quick Action is possible, as shown in the GIF below.\n\nand chains are very common in refactorings, and, although they work, they make the code dirty and difficult to understand. To avoid this kind of problem, an alternative is to use the native C# function, .\n\nWith , we manage to obtain the same result as , but in a more organized and easy-to-understand way. Below is the same example, first using the conditions and second using the .\n\n💡 In Visual Studio, it is possible to use a feature that automatically fills the entire structure. Just type the condition and click below, and the entire structure is created, as can be seen in the GIF below:\n\nInterfaces in C# are objects that represent contracts, guaranteeing that the behavior of the interface will be respected in the classes that implement them.\n\nIt is very common to find classes that do not implement interfaces in refactorings. To solve this problem, we can use a Visual Studio function called Extract Interface that automatically generates an interface based on the selected class, as shown in the example below:\n\nDespite being useful, variables are often unnecessary and pollute the code, making it more difficult to read.\n\nAlways consider if it is really necessary to use a variable—it is often possible to use the ternary operator (?) or some LINQ feature like the method for example, as seen in the example below:\n\nRenaming methods or variables can be time-consuming if you don’t know how to use the right resources. Imagine renaming a method that is used by dozens of classes. To streamline this task, a feature in Visual Studio will rename the object in all its references.\n\nJust right-click on the name you want to rename and choose “Rename,” enter the new name and click “Apply.”\n\nRemoving unnecessary instances is always a good practice in refactorings, as it leaves the code clean, with fewer lines.\n\nVisual Studio has a feature to facilitate removal. Just position the cursor over a that is not being used, click on the lightbulb icon, and choose the option “Remove unnecessary usings.” In the open window, you will have options for removal at the Document, Project or Solution level.\n\nAs developers, we often need to save time, and a very useful function in Visual Studio is that you can generate methods automatically. Just write your declaration and pass the input arguments, then click the lightbulb icon and choose the option “Generate Method,” as shown in the GIF below:\n\nAs seen in the article, refactoring is an ever-present task in the day of software development, and to make this work easier there are many resources—especially if you are using Visual Studio.\n\nSo, the next refactoring you do, don’t forget to review these tips and put them into practice."

        "document": "A Cloud Code module is a simple .NET project that exposes the endpoints a game client can call. Modules adopt a similar paradigm as .NET class libraries. For example, a standard C# class might look like the following:\n\nOnce compiled, any reference to the class can only use the method.\n\nThis allows developers to choose the interface of their library through access modifiers. Cloud Code modules work in the same way, however they use the attribute instead.\n\nWith Cloud Code modules, you can create self-contained server-authoritative libraries. This allows you to run your game logic on the server, and call it from the client, which detaches the game logic from the client and increases security. Modules provide code reuse and provide an interface you can use to manage your game logic.\n\nA Cloud Code module project is a class library C# project. The project can also be part of a solution. The simplest project structure can look like this:\n\nOr, if in a solution, it can look like this:\n\nThe solution can also contain multiple projects that reference each other. This allows you to easily add test projects, and enables code reuse. The example below shows a valid project structure:\n\nHowever, only the main project can contain Cloud Code functions.\n\nRefer to Write unit tests to learn more about how to write unit tests for your Cloud Code module.\n\nRefer to Cloud Code limits to check what storage restrictions apply.\n\nAlthough the solution can contain multiple C# projects, you can have only one main project per module. The main project contains all your module entry points (functions with attributes).\n\nThe main project is also the project that you deploy to the Cloud Code service. You don't deploy the projects and dependencies that aren't referenced in the main project to the Cloud Code service.\n\nYou need to match the name of the main project to the name of the archive that you deploy to the Cloud Code service.\n\nThe simplest module project can have the following structure:\n\nThe sample below defines a Cloud Code module with a single function that returns the string :\n\nAs .NET projects, Cloud Code module projects also use NuGet to share packaged code.\n\nTo learn more about NuGet, refer to Microsoft documentation.\n\nCloud Code offers two packages that you can include in your modules:\n• : this package contains the core functionality of Cloud Code, including the attribute. All Cloud Code modules require this package.\n• : this is an optional package that contains the Unity Gaming Services APIs that you can use to interact with the Cloud Code service. You can use this package to call out to other Cloud Code SDKs, such as Cloud Save.\n\nFor more information, see the documentation on how to install and use NuGet packages in your project with Jetbrains Rider or Visual Studio.\n\nTo avoid issues with code structure, follow these guidelines.\n\nTo mark a method as a Cloud Code function and make it a viable Cloud Code module endpoint, use the attribute. You can only use Cloud Code function attributes in the main class of your modules.\n\nTo invoke the function, you need to call the name of the attribute.\n\nUse the structure below for the method signature of your module function.\n\nYou can use singleton pattern to integrate with Cloud Code C# packages and external service calls. Singleton patterns improve performance and scalability in Cloud Code and ensure that you don't create multiple instances of the same object.\n\nYou can use Dependency Injection to inject the and interfaces into your modules.\n\nYou can pass in parameters to your module functions.\n\nThis includes any primitive types, such as , , , and , as well as complex types, such as , , and .\n\nFor example, you can pass in a and a to your module function:\n\nDefine your module function with the same parameters:\n\nYou can also pass in any custom types that you define in your module project.\n\nFor example, you can pass in a JSON object to your module object:\n\nDefine a and classes and a function in your module project:\n\nCloud Code modules can use , , , and interfaces to expand the functionality of your modules.\n\nThe interface allows you to manage the dependencies of your modules. Learn more about it in the Dependency Injection documentation.\n\nThe interface provides a way to access the Cloud Code C# Client SDKs. You can use Dependency Injection to inject the into your modules.\n• Define a class that implements the interface and add the as a singleton:\n• Pass in the interface as a function parameter to your module functions.\n\nThe interface provides a way to access the Cloud Code C# Admin SDKs. You can use Dependency Injection to inject the into your modules.\n• Define a class that implements the interface and add the as a singleton:\n• Pass in the interface as a function parameter to your module functions.\n\nThe interface provides a way to send push notifications to players. You can use Dependency Injection to inject the into your modules.\n• Define a class that implements the interface and add the as a singleton:\n• Pass in the object as a function parameter to your module functions.\n\nTo learn more about how to send push messages from Cloud Code, refer to Push messages.\n\nTo make calls to other UGS services within your module, you can use the interface to get extra information about the current call. You can use the values below to access the service SDKs and see which player makes a request.\n• : The project ID to which the caller was authenticated.\n• : The player ID that executed the script. Note: the player ID isn't available when a service calls the script.\n• : The environment ID of the module.\n• : The environment name of the module.\n• : The JSON Web Token (JWT) credential the player used to authenticate to Cloud Code.\n• : The user ID of the service account. (Note: the user ID is not available when a service calls the script.)\n• : The issuer or the service account token. (Note: the issuer is not available when a player calls the script). For instance, if Multiplay makes a call, the issuer is .\n• : The Analytics User ID of the player. (Note: the analytic user ID is not available when a service calls the script.)\n• : The Unity device installation ID of the player. (Note: the Unity installation ID is not available when a service calls the script.)\n\nYou can use the execution context to acquire the player ID and authenticate with different Unity Gaming Services. You can obtain the execution context through both the constructor of your class, and through any method with the attribute.\n\nFor example, you can use the execution context to call out to Cloud Save to retrieve player keys:\n\nThe and are JWTs and properties of the interface.\n\nYou can use these tokens to authenticate calls to other Unity Gaming Services from Cloud Code.\n\nAny Access Control rules that you configure affect the .\n\nThe sample below shows how you can use the to access an authenticated player's data with Cloud Save:\n\nTo access data for all players, you can use a and pass in a parameter for the :\n\nFor an in-depth explanation of the differences between the two tokens, refer to the Service and access tokens documentation.\n\nTo retrieve a Cloud Code module and its metadata, you can send a request to the Cloud Code service. The response is a JSON object with the following structure:\n\nTags are key-value pairs that you can attach to your Cloud Code modules. You can record any information you want in the tags, such as the version of the module, the author, or the commit hash if you use version control.\n\nModules can store up to 10 tags, and the maximum characters you can use per tag key and tag value is 128.\n\nSigned Download URL is a temporary URL that you can use to download the module archive."
